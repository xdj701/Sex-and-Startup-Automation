preferences of the Preferred Stock as set forth below.

ARTICLE 5
TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK

The Preferred Stock shall have the rights, privileges and preferences set forth below.

Section 1. Dividends. The holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the holders of
the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A-3 Preferred Stock and the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, out of any funds legally available therefor,
noncumulative dividends at the rate of $0.0091 per share in the case of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, $0.0078 per share in the case of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, $0.00228 per share in the
case of the Series A-3 Preferred Stock, and $0.01761 per share in the case of the Series B
Preferred Stock per year (in each case, as adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations,
stock dividends, stock splits and the like), payable in preference and priority to any payment of
any dividend on Common Stock when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. No right
shall accrue to holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock,
holders of Series A-3 Preferred Stock or holders of Series B Preferred Stock by reason of the fact
that dividends on such shares are not declared or paid in any prior year. The holders of the
Preferred Stock also shall be entitled to participate pro rata in any dividends paid on the
Common Stock on an as-if-converted basis.

In the event that the Corporation shall have declared but unpaid dividends outstanding
immediately prior to, and in the event of, a conversion of Preferred Stock (as provided in
Article 5 Section 3 hereof), the Corporation shall, at the option of the Corporation, pay in cash to
each holder of Preferred Stock subject to conversion the full amount of any such dividends or
allow such dividends to be converted into Common Stock in accordance with, and pursuant to
the terms specified in, Article 5 Section 3 hereof.

Section 2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
either voluntary or involuntary, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or
funds of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of
such stock, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive for each outstanding share
of Preferred Stock then held by them an amount equal to (i) in the case of Series B Preferred
Stock, $0.22013 plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately
adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like),
(ii) in the case of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, $0.1142 plus declared but unpaid dividends on
such share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations,
stock dividends, stock splits and the like), (iii) in the case of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock,
$0.0971 plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately
adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like),
and (iv) in the case of Series A-3 Preferred Stock, $0.02855 plus declared but unpaid dividends
on such share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock
combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). If, upon the occurrence of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, the assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for
distribution to stockholders by reason of their ownership of stock of the Corporation shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, holders of the

Series A-1 Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock and holders of the Series A-
3 Preferred Stock of the full aforementioned preferential amounts, then the entire assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders by reason of their
ownership of stock of the Corporation shall be distributed on a pari passu basis among the
holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the aggregate preferential amount each such
holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) After payment has been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the full
amounts to which they shall be entitled as provided in subsection (a) above, all remaining assets
of the Corporation shall be distributed among all holders of the Preferred Stock and all holders of
Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the
number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by each holder of Preferred Stock if all
shares of the Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock at the then effective
Conversion Price (as set forth in Article 5 Section 3(a) below) until: (i) with respect to the Series
B Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate
of $0.66039 per share of Series B Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such
share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock
dividends, stock splits and the like), including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above; (ii)
with respect to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall
have received an aggregate of $0.3426 per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock plus declared but
unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations,
stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like), including amounts paid pursuant
to subsection (a) above; (iii) with respect to the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, the holders of the
Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate of $0.2913 per share of Series A-2
Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately
adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like),
including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above; and (iv) with respect to the Series A-3
Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A-3 Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate
of $0.08565 per share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such
share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock
dividends, stock splits and the like), including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above.
Thereafter, all remaining assets and surplus funds shall be distributed to the holders of Common
Stock pro rata according to the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock then held by
each of them.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed to by the holders of at least a 75% of the Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single group on an as-converted basis), a liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation under this Article 5 Section 2 shall be deemed to be occasioned by, and to
include, (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization of the Corporation with or
into any other corporation, corporations or other entity (excluding any merger effected
exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the corporation); (ii) any other
transaction or series of related transactions, in which the shareholders of the corporation
immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation own less than fifty percent
(50%) of the voting power of the surviving entity; or (iii) a sale, conveyance or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, including pursuant to the grant of an
exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s products, assets or intellectual
property, in one transaction or a series of transactions (any such transaction, a “Liquidation

Event’); provided, that this provision shall not apply if the holders of voting securities of the
Corporation immediately prior to such Liquidation Event beneficially own, directly or indirectly,
a majority of the combined voting power of the surviving entity resulting from such Liquidation
Event.

(d) Notwithstanding this Article 5 Section 2, each holder of Preferred Stock shall
have the right to elect the benefits of the provisions of Article 5 Section 3(a) below or other
applicable conversion provisions in lieu of receiving payment on any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, pursuant to this Article 5
Section 2.

(e) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the Corporation or its
stockholders is other than cash or securities, its value will be deemed its fair market value, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through Nasdaq, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or
system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of the transaction
in subsection 2(c) above;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30) day
period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of the transaction in subsection 2(c) above; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other
restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in subsection (i)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the
approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

Section 3. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for such Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable original issue
price of such shares of Preferred Stock (the “Original Issue Price”) by the applicable conversion
price for such series of Preferred Stock that is in effect at the time of conversion (the
“Conversion Price” and, such resulting ratio, the “Conversion Rate”). The Original Issue Price
per share of Series B Preferred Stock is $0.22013 (as appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original

Issue Price per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock is $0.1142 (as appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original
Issue Price per share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock is $0.0971 (as appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original
Issue Price per share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock is $0.02855 (as appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). The initial
Conversion Price per share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be $0.22013, the initial Conversion
Price per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be $0.1142, the initial Conversion Price per
share of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be $0.0971, and the initial Conversion Price per
share of the Series A-3 Preferred Stock shall be $0.02855, in each case subject to adjustment
from time to time as provided below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable Conversion Rate for
each series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of: (i) the effectiveness of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’), covering the offer and sale of
Common Stock with an offering price per share of not less than $1.10 (as appropriately adjusted
for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like) and
aggregate proceeds to the Corporation of not less than $25,000,000 (net of underwriting
discounts and commissions) (a “Qualified IPO”), or (ii) the date specified pursuant to an
election to convert all shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock by holders of at least 75%
of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single group on an as-
converted basis, at a duly held meeting or by written consent or other agreement.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which a holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. Before any holder
of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, the
holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
Corporation at such office that the holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall also state
whether the holder elects, subject to Article 5 Section 1 hereof, to receive declared but unpaid
dividends on the Preferred Stock proposed to be converted in cash, or to convert such dividends
into shares of Common Stock at their fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors.
The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount
of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into a fractional share of Common
Stock, and, subject to Article 5 Section 1 hereof, any declared but unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock which the holder elected to receive in cash. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Article 5

Section 3(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically
without any further action by the holders of such Preferred Stock and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; and
provided, further, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates
evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent as provided above, or such holder of Preferred Stock notifies the Corporation or its transfer
agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in
connection with such certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such
delivery, or such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver
at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled and a check
payable to such holder of Preferred Stock in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the
result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock and any declared but unpaid
dividends on the converted Preferred Stock which the holder elected to receive in cash.

If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities pursuant to
the Securities Act in accordance with Article 5 Section 3(b)(i) above, the conversion may, at the
option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the
closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event
the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall not
be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such
sale of securities.

If the conversion is in connection with a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation described in Article 5 Section 2 above, the conversion may, at the option of any
holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the
consummation of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up, in which event the person(s) entitled
to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have
converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the consummation of the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up.

(x) shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion or
exercise of Options or Convertible Securities (or upon conversion of securities issuable upon

(xi) any other securities issued or issuable upon conversion
and/or exercise of any securities issued upon the written consent of the holders of at least 75% of
the Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single group on an as-converted basis,
that such shares shall not constitute Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the applicable
Conversion Price of a particular share of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the issuance
of Additional Shares of Common Stock unless the consideration per share for an Additional
Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less than the
applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue, for
such share of Preferred Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(1) Options and Convertible Securities. Except as provided in
Article 5 Section 3(d)(i)(4) above, in the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time
after the Filing Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date
for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment
of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, provided that Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been
issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Article 5 Section 3(d)(v)
hereof) of such Additional Shares of Common Stock would be less than the applicable
Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record
date, as the case may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares
of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A) no further adjustment in a Conversion Price shall be made
upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase (or decrease) in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, or decrease (or increase) in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, each applicable Conversion Price
computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect
thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or
decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it
affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised,
each applicable Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the

occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon,
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(i) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options
for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually
received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange; and

(ii) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities,
only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at
the time of issue of such Options and the consideration received by the Corporation for the
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation upon the issue of the
Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall
have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price for that series on the original adjustment
date, or (ii) the Conversion Price for that series that would have resulted from any issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment
date.

(2) Stock Dividends. Except as provided in Article 5 Section
3(d)(i)(4) above, in the event the Corporation, at any time or from time to time after the date of
filing hereof, shall declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common
Stock, then Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued
immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of any
class of securities entitled to receive such dividend.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock
(including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Article 5
Section 3(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price with respect to any series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior
to such issue, then and in such event, such Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock
shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest $0.00001)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the
number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would
purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such

Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued; and provided, further, that, for the purposes of
this Article 5 Section 3(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock and all outstanding Convertible Securities, and upon exercise of all
outstanding Options bearing an exercise price which is lower than the price at which the
Additional Shares of Common Stock were issued (or deemed to be issued), shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Article 5
Section 3(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issuance, as determined by the Board of
Directors in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment; and

(C) inthe event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which
covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Article 5 Section 3(d)(iii)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Securities,
shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(3) Stock Dividends. Any Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued relating to stock dividends shall be deemed to have been issued for
no consideration.

(vi) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for
Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that (a) the Corporation at any
time or from time to time on or after the Filing Date shall declare or pay, without consideration,
any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or in any right to acquire
Common Stock for no consideration, (b) the Corporation at any time or from time to time on or
after the Filing Date shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by
payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or (c) the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price for any
series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such event shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. In the
event that the Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the
Common Stock payable in any right to acquire Common Stock for no consideration, then the
Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an amount of
shares equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire
Common Stock.

(vii) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a
different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for in Article 5 Section 3(d)(vi) above or a merger or other reorganization referred to in
Article 5 Section 2 above), the Conversion Prices then in effect shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the
various series of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into a number of shares of such other class
or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been
subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that
change.

(viii) Reorganizations, Mergers, Consolidations or Sales of Assets. If at any
time or from time to time on or after the Filing Date, there is a Capital Reorganization (other
than a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation as defined in Article 5 Section 2
or as a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of
shares provided for elsewhere in this Article 5 Section 3), provision shall be made as a part of
such Capital Reorganization to the effect that the holders of the various series of Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of
shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation to which a holder of the number
of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such
Capital Reorganization, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms
thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Article 5 Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock
after the Capital Reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Article 5 Section 3
(including adjustment of the Conversion Prices then in effect and the number of shares issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent as practicable.

(1) For purposes of this Article 5 Section 3(d)(viii), a “Capital
Reorganization” shall mean a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
person (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing entity
and which does not result in any change in the Common Stock) or a capital reorganization of the
Common Stock (other than as a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification,
exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Article 5 Section 3).

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any Capital
Reorganization that constitutes a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (as
defined in Article 5 Section 2 above), the holders of at least 75% of all outstanding Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single group on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect, by
providing written notice of such election to the Corporation within twenty (20) days of receiving
notice of such Capital Reorganization, to treat such transaction as a Capital Reorganization and
not as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, in which event the provisions
of this Article 5 Section 3(d)(viii) shall apply. Such election shall apply to all outstanding
Preferred Stock. In the absence of such an election, a Capital Reorganization that constitutes a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be treated as a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and not as a Capital Reorganization.

(ix) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at any
time or from time to time makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other
than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Article 5 Section 3,
then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall
receive upon such distribution the amount of securities of the Corporation which they would
have received had their Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock on the date of such event
and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of
conversion, retained such securities receivable by than as aforesaid during such period, subject to
all other adjustments called for during such period under this Article 5 Section 3 with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(e) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Article 5 Section 3, the Corporation shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof. The
Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish
or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (i) the particulars of any
adjustment to the Conversion Price since issuance of the Preferred Stock, (ii) the Conversion
Price for such series of Preferred Stock currently in effect and (iii) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received
upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at any
time:

(i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in
cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or
not out of earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock
shares outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock shares; or

(iii) to merge with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey all or
substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up;

then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall send to the holders of the
Preferred Stock:

(1) at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice of the date on which a
record shall be taken for such dividend or distribution (and specifying the date on which the
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) in respect of the matters referred to in (i)
above or for determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in (ii) and (iii) above;
and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii), above, at least ten (10)
days’ prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and specifying the date on
which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for
securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).

Each such written notice shall be delivered personally, given by facsimile or given by first class
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of Preferred Stock shares at the address for each
such holder as shown on the books of the Corporation.

Section 4. Voting Rights and Directors.

(a) Vote Other than for Directors. Except as otherwise required by law and as
provided in the next sentence and in subsection (b) below with respect to the election of directors
and in Article 5 Section 5 below with respect to the Protective Provisions, the holders of
Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’
meeting and will vote together and not as separate classes upon any matter submitted to the
stockholders for a vote, as follows: (i) each holder of Preferred Stock shall have one vote for
each full share of Common Stock into which such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock would be

vote per share of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be
increased or decreased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock, voting together as one class and each holder of Preferred Stock having that
number of votes per share as is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which each
such share of Preferred Stock held by such holder could be converted pursuant to Article 5

Section 3 on the date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote on such increase or
decrease.

(b) Number and Election of Directors.
(i) The authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be five (5).

class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member to the Board of Directors at each meeting or
pursuant to each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors.

(iii) For so long as at least 3,500,000 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock

shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to
each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors.

(iv) For so long as at least 6,200,000 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reclassification and the like) of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of at least
75% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single group on an as-
converted basis, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board of Directors at each
meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of
directors.

(v) The remaining two members of the Board of Directors shall be elected by
the holders of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock voting together as a single class on an
as-converted basis.

(c) Vacancies; Removal. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors occurring because
of the death, resignation or removal of a director elected in accordance with Article 5 Section
4(b) above shall be filled by the vote or written consent of such percentage of the voting group
which elected such director as specified in Article 5 Section 4(b) above, or, in the absence of
such action by such holders, by unanimous action of the remaining director or directors elected
by the holders of such class. A director may be removed from the Board of Directors with or
without cause by the vote or consent of the voting group entitled to elect such director in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 5. Protective Provisions. In addition to any other rights provided by law, the
Corporation shall not (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), without first obtaining the
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single group on an as-converted
basis):

(a) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the Preferred Stock, by way
of merger, consolidation, substitution, reclassification, amendment, or otherwise, so as to

adversely affect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or the restrictions provided for
the benefit of, such shares of Preferred Stock;

shall be converted pursuant to Article 5 Section 3 hereof, the shares so converted shall

extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as it now exists or as it may hereafter
be amended, not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is

eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as so amended.

Section 2. Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law any person made or threatened to be made a party to an action or

Corporation, or serves or served at any other enterprise as a director or officer at the request of
the Corporation or any predecessor to the Corporation. The Corporation will advance expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of

“Investor”), and in his or her capacity as an Investor, and not as a director, acquires knowledge
of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity both for the Fund and the
Corporation (a “Corporate Opportunity”), then: (i) such Corporate Opportunity shall belong to
the Fund and not to the Corporation; (ii) the Corporation, to the extent allowed by law, waives
any claim that the Investor or the Fund should have presented the Corporate Opportunity to the
Corporation or any of its affiliates; and (iii) such director shall, to the extent permitted by law,
