authorized to issue is 77,933,511, consisting of 70,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $.001 par
value per share, and 7,933,511 shares of Preferred Stock, 5.001 par value per share, of which
7,823,419 shares are designated “Series A-1 Preferred Stock” and 110,092 of which shares are

Preferred Stock are referred to herein collectively as the “Series A Preferred Stock.” The rights,
preferences, and other terms of the Preferred Stock are set forth in Article 5. The Common
Stock is subject to the rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock as set forth below.

ARTICLE 5
TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK
The Preferred Stock shall have the rights, privileges and preferences set forth below.

Section. Dividends. The holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the holders
of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, out of any funds legally available

therefor, noncumulative dividends at the rate of Two and Sixty-One Hundredths Cents ($0.0261)
per share in the case of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Two and Twenty-Two Hundredths
Cents ($0.0222) per share in the case of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock per year (in each case as
adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like),
payable in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on Common Stock when, as
and if declared by the Board of Directors. No right shall accrue to holders of Series A-1
Preferred Stock or holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on
such shares are not declared or paid in any prior year. The holders of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock and holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock also shall be entitled to participate pro rata in
any dividends paid on the Common Stock on an as-if-converted basis.

In the event that the Corporation shall have declared but unpaid dividends outstanding
immediately prior to, and in the event of, a conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and
Series A-2 Preferred Stock (as provided in Article 5 Section 3 hereof), the Corporation shall, at
the option of the Corporation, pay in cash to each holder of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and
Series A-2 Preferred Stock subject to conversion the full amount of any such dividends or allow
such dividends to be converted into Common Stock in accordance with, and pursuant to the
terms specified in, Article 5 Section 3 hereof.

Section 2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, prior and in preference to any distribution of
any of the assets or funds of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason
of their ownership of such stock, (i) the holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive for each outstanding share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock then held by them
an amount equal to Thirty-Two and Fifty-Eight Hundredths Cents ($0.3258) plus declared
but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like) (the “Series
A-1 Liquidation Preference’) and (ii) the holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive for each outstanding share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock then held by them
an amount equal to Twenty-Seven and Sixty-Nine Hundredths Cents (80.2769) plus declared
but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like) (the “Series
A-2 Liquidation Preference"). If, upon the occurrence of a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, the assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to
stockholders by reason of their ownership of stock of the Corporation shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to such holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and holders of the
Series A-2 Preferred Stock of the full aforementioned preferential amounts, then the entire
assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders by
reason of their ownership of stock of the Corporation shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock in
proportion to the aggregate preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive.

() After payment has been made to the holders of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Preferred Stock of the full amounts to which they shall be

entitled as provided in subsection (a) above, all remaining assets of the Corporation shall be
distributed among all holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A-2
Preferred Stock and all holders of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding and the number of shares of Common Stock which would be
held by each holder of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and each holder of the Series A-2
Preferred Stock if all shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock
were converted into Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Price (as set forth in
Article 5 Section 3(a) below).

(c) For purposes of this Article 5 Section 2, unless otherwise agreed to by
the holders of at least a majority of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-2
Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class), a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, and to include, the Corporation’s sale
of all or substantially all of its assets or the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity
by means of merger or consolidation resulting in the exchange of the outstanding shares of
the Corporation for securities or consideration issued, or caused to be issued, by the acquiring
corporation in which the holders of the capital stock of the Corporation then hold less than
Fifty Percent (50%) of the voting securities of the surviving corporation.

(d) Notwithstanding this Article 5 Section 2, each holder of Preferred
Stock shall have the right to elect the benefits of the provisions of Article 5 Section 3(a)
below or other applicable conversion provisions in lieu of receiving payment on any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary,
pursuant to this Article 5 Section 2.

(e) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the Corporation
or its stockholders is other than cash or securities, its value will be deemed its fair market
value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued
as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange or through Nasdaq, the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such
exchange or system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing
of the transaction in subsection 2(c) above;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the
thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of the transaction in
subsection 2(c) above; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter
or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a
stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate

discount from the market value determined as above in subsection (i)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

Section 3. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the
option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office
of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such Preferred Stock, into such number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable
Original Issue Price of such shares of Preferred Stock by the applicable Conversion Price at
the time in effect for shares of such series of Preferred Stock. The Original Issue Price per
share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock is Thirty-Two and Fifty-Eight Hundredths Cents
($0.3258) (as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock
dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original Issue Price per share of Series A-2
Preferred Stock is Twenty-Seven and Sixty-Nine Hundredths ($0.2769) (as appropriately
adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the
like). The initial Conversion Price per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be Thirty-
Two and Fifty-Eight Hundredths Cents ($0.3258), and the initial Conversion Price per share
of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be Twenty-Seven and Sixty-Nine Hundredths
($0.2769), in each case subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable Conversion Price for
each series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the effectiveness of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering the offer and
sale of Common Stock with an aggregate offering price of not less than Fifteen Million
Dollars ($15,000,000), or (ii) the date specified pursuant to an election to convert all Series
A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock into Common Stock by holders of at
least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2
Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class), at a duly held meeting or by written
consent or other agreement.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which a holder
would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied
by the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors.
Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of
Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and
shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that the holder elects to convert the
same. Such notice shall also state whether the holder elects, pursuant to Article 5 Section 1
hereof, to receive declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock proposed to be
converted in cash, or to convert such dividends into shares of Common Stock at their fair
market value as determined by the Board of Directors. The Corporation shall, as soon as

practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall
be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts
payable as the result of a conversion into a fractional share of Common Stock, and any
declared but unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock which the holder elected to
receive in cash. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to
the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic
conversion pursuant to Article 5 Section 3(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such
Preferred Stock and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered
to the Corporation or its transfer agent; and provided, further, that the Corporation shall not
be obligated to issue certificates evincing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
automatic conversion unless the certificates evincing such shares of Preferred Stock are
either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or such holder of
Preferred Stock notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.
The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder
of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which such holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled and a check payable to such holder of
Preferred Stock in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into
fractional shares of Common Stock and any declared but unpaid dividends on the converted
Preferred Stock which the holder elected to receive in cash.

If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities pursuant to
the Securities Act in accordance with Article 5 Section 3(b)(i) above, the conversion may, at the
option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the
closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event
the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall not
be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such
sale of securities.

If the conversion is in connection with a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation described in Article 5 Section 2 above, the conversion may, at the option of any
holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Liquidation Event, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the
Common Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such
Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the consummation of the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

Convertible Securities outstanding on the Filing Date.

(ix) Shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion or
exercise of Options or Convertible Securities already deemed to be issued pursuant to Article 5
Section 3(d)(iii); or

(x) pursuant to a vote of a majority of the Series A Preferred
Stock that such shares shall not be deemed “Additional Securities.”

(ii) No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the applicable
Conversion Price of a particular share of Preferred Stock shall be made in respect of the
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock unless the consideration per share for an
Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is less
than the applicable Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date
of, and immediately prior to such issue, for such share of Preferred Stock.

(iii) Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(1) Options and Convertible Securities. Except as provided in
Article 5 Section 3(d)(i)(4) above, in the event the Corporation at any time or from time to
time after the Filing Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a
record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any
such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in
the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of
Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have
been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share
(determined pursuant to Article 5 Section 3(d)(v) hereof) of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock would be less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case may be, and provided further
that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be
made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon
the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase (or decrease) in the
consideration payable to the Corporation, or decrease (or increase) in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion

Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with
respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such
increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease
insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such
Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been
exercised, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:

(i) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options
for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether
or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such
exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities, plus the additional consideration,
if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange; and

(ii) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof
were issued at the time of issue of such Options and the consideration received by the
Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued
was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options,
whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the
Corporation upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options
were actually exercised; and

(i) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to
an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price for that series on the original
adjustment date, or (ii) the Conversion Price for that series that would have resulted from any
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and
such readjustment date.

(2) Stock Dividends. In the event the Corporation, at any time or
from time to time after the date of filing hereof, shall declare or pay any dividend on the
Common Stock payable in Common Stock, then Additional Shares of Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been issued immediately after the close of business on the record date for
the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive such dividend.

(iv) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares
of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common
Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Article 5 Section 3(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the

Conversion Price with respect to any series of Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such Conversion Price for such
series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the
aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock
so issued; and provided further that, for the purposes of this Article 5 Section 3(d)(iv), all
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock and all
outstanding Convertible Securities, and upon exercise of all outstanding Options bearing an
exercise price which is lower than the price at which the Additional Shares of Common
Stock were issued (or deemed to be issued), shall be deemed to be outstanding, and
immediately after any Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed issued pursuant to
subsection (iii), such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Article 5
Section 3(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issuance, as determined by the Board of
Directors in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been issued pursuant to Article 5 Section 3(d)(iii)(1), relating to Options and Convertible
Securities, shall be determined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
Minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent

adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of
Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

(3) Stock Dividends. Any Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued relating to stock dividends shall be deemed to have been issued
for no consideration.

(vi) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for
Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock In the event that the Corporation at any
time or from time to time on or after the Filing Date (a) shall declare or pay, without
consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or in any right
to acquire Common Stock for no consideration, or (b) shall effect a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by
stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or
in any right to acquire Common Stock), or (c) in the event the outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser
number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. In the event that the
Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock
payable in any right to acquire Common Stock for no consideration, then the Corporation
shall be deemed to have made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares
equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire
Common Stock.

(vii) Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a
different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of
shares provided for in Article 5 Section 3(d)(vi) above or a merger or other reorganization
referred to in Article 5 Section 2 above), the Conversion Prices then in effect shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be
proportionately adjusted so that the various series of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into
a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares
of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

(viii) Reorganizations. Mergers. Consolidations or Sales of Assets. If at any

time or from time to time on or after the Filing Date, there is a Capital Reorganization (other
than a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation as defined in Article 5

Section 2 or as a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or
substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Article Section 3), provision shall be
made as a part of such Capital Reorganization to the effect that the holders of the various
series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or propery of the
Corporation to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such Capital Reorganization, subject to adjustment
in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Article 5 Section 3 with
respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after the Capital Reorganization to the
end that the provisions of this Article 5 Section 3 (including adjustment of the Conversion
Prices then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(1) For purposes of this Article 5 Section 3(d)(viii), a “Capital
Reorganization” shall mean a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
person (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing entity
and which does not result in any change in the Common Stock) or a capital reorganization of
the Common Stock (other than as a recapitalization, subdivision, combination,
reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Article 5
Section 3).

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any Capital
Reorganization that constitutes a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (as
defined in Article 5 Section 2 above), the holders of a majority of all outstanding Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to elect, by providing written notice of such election to the
Corporation within twenty (20) days of receiving notice of such Capital Reorganization, to
treat such transaction as a Capital Reorganization and not as a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, in which event the provisions of this Article 5
Section 3(d)(viii) shall apply. Such election shall apply to all outstanding Preferred Stock.
In the absence of such an election, a Capital Reorganization that constitutes a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation and not as a Capital Reorganization.

(ix) Adjustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at
any time or from time to time makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in securities of the Corporation
other than shares of Common Stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Article 5
Section 3, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of
Preferred Stock shall receive upon such distribution the amount of securities of the
Corporation which they would have received had their Preferred Stock converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the
