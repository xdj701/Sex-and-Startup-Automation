prior certificate of incorporation, all in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General
Corporation Law.

3. The holders of the requisite number of shares of this corporation, acting by means
of a written consent in lieu of a meeting pursuant to Section 228(a) of the General Corporation
Law, adopted and approved this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in

FIRST: The name of this corporation is EBTH Inc. (the “Corporation”).

SECOND: The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of

value per share (“Common Stock”), and (ii) 32,249,329 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.001 par
value per share (“Preferred Stock”).

The following is a statement of the designations and the powers, privileges and rights,
and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof in respect of each class of capital stock
of the Corporation.

A. COMMON STOCK

1. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders
of the Preferred Stock set forth herein.

2. Voting. The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share
of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and written actions in lieu of meetings);
provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as
such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock
if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of
one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation or pursuant to the General Corporation Law. There shall be no cumulative
voting. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but
not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding or reserved for issuance) by (in addition
to any vote of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock that may be required by the
terms of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) the affirmative vote of the
holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the votes
represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote,
irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law.

B. PREFERRED STOCK

13,080,000 shares of authorized and unissued Preferred Stock of the Corporation are
hereby designated “Series A Preferred Stock” and 19,169,329 shares of authorized and
unissued Preferred Stock of the Corporation are hereby designated “Series B Preferred Stock,”
in each case with the following rights, preferences, powers, privileges and restrictions,
qualifications and limitations. Unless otherwise indicated, references to “Sections” or
“Subsections” in this Part B of this Article Fourth refer to sections and subsections of Part B of
this Article Fourth. The Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock are hereafter
referred to collectively as the “Series Preferred.”

1. Dividends.

The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any other
class or series of capital stock of the Corporation (other than dividends on shares of Common
Stock payable in shares of Common Stock) unless (in addition to the obtaining of any consents
required elsewhere in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) the holders of the
Series Preferred then outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, on a pari passu
basis, a dividend on each outstanding share of Series Preferred in an amount at least equal to (i)
in the case of a dividend on Common Stock or any class or series that is convertible into
Common Stock, that dividend per share of Series Preferred as would equal the product of (A) the
dividend payable on each share of such class or series determined, if applicable, as if all shares
of such class or series had been converted into Common Stock and (B) the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series Preferred, in each case calculated

on the record date for determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend or (ii) in the case
of a dividend on any class or series that is not convertible into Common Stock, at a rate per share
of Series Preferred determined by (A) dividing the amount of the dividend payable on each share
of such class or series of capital stock by the original issuance price of such class or series of
capital stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to such class or series) and (B)
multiplying such fraction by an amount equal to the applicable Series Preferred Original Issue
Price (as defined below); provided that, if the Corporation declares, pays or sets aside, on the
same date, a dividend on shares of more than one class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation, the dividend payable to the holders of Series Preferred pursuant to this Section 1
shall be calculated based upon the dividend on the class or series of capital stock that would
result in the highest Series Preferred dividend. As used herein, the term “Series Preferred
Original Issue Price” shall mean (y) in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, $1.00 per
share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (the
“Series A Original Issue Price”), and (z) in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, $1.565 per
share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock (the
“Series B Original Issue Price”).

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up: Certain Mergers. Consolidations and
Asset Sales.

2.1 Preferential Payments to Holders of Series Preferred.

2.1.1 In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or any Deemed Liquidation Event, the holders of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders before any payment shall be made
to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock or the holders of Common Stock by reason of their
ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) one (1) times the Series B
Original Issue Price, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, if any, or (ii) such amount
per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series B Preferred Stock been converted
into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution,
winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event (the amount payable pursuant to this sentence is
hereinafter referred to as the “Series B Liquidation Amount”). If upon any such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or any such Deemed Liquidation Event, the assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the
holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled
under this Subsection 2.1.1, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall share ratably
in any distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts
which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if
all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

2.1.2 In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or any Deemed Liquidation Event, after payment in

full of the aggregate Series B Liquidation Amount, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to its stockholders before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common
Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) one (1)
times the Series A Original Issue Price, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, if
any, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series A
Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 immediately prior to
such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event (the amount payable
pursuant to this sentence is hereinafter referred to as the “Series A Liquidation Amount”). If
upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or any such Deemed
Liquidation Event, after payment in full of the aggregate Series B Liquidation Amount, the assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled
under this Subsection 2.1.2, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably
in any distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts
which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if
all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

2.2 Payments to Holders of Common Stock. In the event of any voluntary
or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or any Deemed
Liquidation Event, after the payment of all amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares
of Series Preferred pursuant to Subsection 2.1, the remaining assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of Common
Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares held by each such holder.

2.3 Deemed Liquidation Events.

2.3.1 Definition. Each of the following events shall be
considered a “Deemed Liquidation Event” unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Series Preferred (which majority must include the affirmative vote of the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock held by Greenspring Global Partners VI-A, 1.P., Greenspring Global
Partners VI-C, 1.P. and Greenspring Opportunities II, 1.P. (collectively, “Greenspring”)) elect
otherwise by written notice sent to the Corporation at least 10 days prior to the effective date of
any such event:

(a) amerger or consolidation in which
(i) the Corporation is a constituent party or
(ii) a subsidiary of the Corporation is a
constituent party and the Corporation issues
shares of its capital stock pursuant to such

merger or consolidation,

except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the
shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such merger or

consolidation continue to represent, or are converted into or exchanged for shares of capital stock
that represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, a majority of the voting
power of the capital stock of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the surviving or
resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following
such merger or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or resulting corporation;
or

(b) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other
disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the sale or disposition (whether by merger or otherwise) of one
or more subsidiaries of the Corporation if substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by such subsidiary or subsidiaries, except where such sale,
lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Corporation.

2.3.2 Effecting a Deemed Liquidation Event.

(a) The Corporation shall not have the power to effect a
Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in Subsection 2.3.1(a)(i) unless the agreement or plan of
merger or consolidation for such transaction (the “Merger Agreement”) provides that the
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the
holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2.1 and 2.2.

(b) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event referred
to in Subsection 2.3.1(a) or 2.3.1(b), if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the
Corporation under the General Corporation Law within 90 days after such Deemed Liquidation
Event, then (i) the Corporation shall send a written notice to each holder of Series Preferred no
later than the 90th day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising such holders of their right
(and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following
clause (ii) to require the redemption of such shares of Series Preferred, and (ii) if the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred so request in a written instrument
delivered to the Corporation not later than 120 days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, the
Corporation shall use the consideration received by the Corporation for such Deemed
Liquidation Event (net of any retained liabilities associated with the assets sold or licensed, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation), together with any other
assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, all to the extent permitted
by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders (the “Available Proceeds”), on the
150th day after such Deemed Liquidation Event, to redeem all outstanding shares of Series
Preferred at a price per share equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount or Series B Liquidation
Amount, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a redemption pursuant to
the preceding sentence, if the Available Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding
shares of Series Preferred, then (y) first, the Corporation shall redeem ratably from the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock such number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as the Corporation
shall have funds legally available therefor and shall redeem the remainder of such shares of
Series B Preferred Stock immediately as assets or funds become legally available therefor until

the aggregate Series B Liquidation Amount is paid in full, and (z) second, after the aggregate
Series B Liquidation Amount has been paid in full, the Corporation shall redeem ratably from the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock such number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock as the
Corporation shall have funds legally available therefor and shall redeem the remainder of such
shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately as assets or funds become legally available
therefor until the aggregate Series A Liquidation Amount is paid in full. The provisions of
Section 4 shall apply, with such necessary changes in the details thereof as are necessitated by
the context, to the redemption of the Series Preferred pursuant to this Subsection 2.3.2(b). Prior
to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Subsection 2.3.2(b), the Corporation shall
not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such Deemed Liquidation Event, except to
discharge expenses incurred in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event or in the
ordinary course of business.

2.3.3. Amount Deemed Paid or Distributed. The amount
deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital stock of the Corporation upon any such
merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, exclusive license, other disposition or redemption shall be
the cash or the value of the property, rights or securities paid or distributed to such holders by the
Corporation or the acquiring person, firm or other entity. The value of such property, rights or
securities shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

2.3.4 Allocation of Escrow and Additional Consideration. In
any Deemed Liquidation Event, if any portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of
the Corporation is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the “Additional
Consideration”), the Merger Agreement or other documentation relating to the Deemed
Liquidation Event shall provide that (a) the portion of such consideration that is not Additional
Consideration (such portion, the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders
of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2.1 and 2.2 as if the Initial
Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such Deemed Liquidation
Event and (b) any Additional Consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the
Corporation upon satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2.1 and 2.2. after taking into
account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction. For
purposes of this Subsection 2.3.4, consideration placed into escrow or retained as holdback to be
available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar obligations in connection with such
Deemed Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be Additional Consideration.

3. Voting.

3.1 General. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the
Corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
(or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of
Series Preferred shall be entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares
of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Preferred held by such holder are convertible
as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as
provided by law or by the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Series
Preferred shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.

3.2 Election of Directors. The holders of record of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of
the Corporation (the “Series B Director”), the holders of record of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of
the Corporation (the “Series A Director,” and together with the Series B Director, collectively
the “Series Preferred Directors”), and the holders of record of the shares of Common Stock,
exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation.
Any director elected as provided in the preceding sentence may be removed with or without
cause by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of
capital stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such
stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders. If the
holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, or Common Stock, as
the case may be, fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which
they are entitled to elect directors, voting exclusively and as a separate class, pursuant to the first
sentence of this Subsection 3.2, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such
time as the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, or Common Stock,
as the case may be, elect a person to fill such directorship by vote or written consent in lieu of a
meeting; and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than by
the stockholders of the Corporation that are entitled to elect a person to fill such directorship,
voting exclusively and as a separate class (except that prior to the time the first share of Series B
Preferred Stock is issued, the vacancy of the Series B Director may be filled (either contingently
or otherwise) by a majority of the directors then in office). The holders of record of the shares of
Common Stock and of any other class or series of voting stock (including the Series Preferred),
exclusively and voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the balance of the total
number of the directors of the Corporation. At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a
director, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of the class or series entitled to elect such director shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of
electing such director. Except as otherwise provided in this Subsection 3.2, a vacancy in any
directorship filled by the holders of any class or series shall be filled only by vote or written
consent in lieu of a meeting of the holders of such class or series or by any remaining director or
directors elected by the holders of such class or series pursuant to this Subsection 3.2.

3.3 Series A Preferred Protective Provisions. At any time when shares of
Series A Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,
stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series A Preferred
Stock) are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, either directly or indirectly by amendment,
merger, consolidation or otherwise, do any of the following without (in addition to any other
vote required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) the written
consent or affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may
be) separately as a single class (on an as-if-converted basis), and any such act or transaction

privilege, or (ii) reclassify, alter or amend any existing security of the Corporation that is junior
to the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of the distribution of assets on the liquidation,

Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series Preferred may be converted into shares
of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

4.1.2 Termination of Conversion Rights. In the event of a
notice of redemption of any shares of Series Preferred pursuant to Section 6, the Conversion
Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last
full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on
such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until
such price is paid in full. In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall
terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of
any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Series Preferred.

4.2 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of the Series Preferred. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series
Preferred the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

43 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.3.1 Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Series
Preferred to voluntarily convert shares of Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock, such
holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series Preferred (or, if such
registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Series Preferred (or at

the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent),
together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of
the Series Preferred represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on
which such conversion is contingent. Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of
the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall
be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or
its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the
transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice shall be the time of conversion
(the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such
date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of
the Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of the holder tendering Series
Preferred for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of
securities pursuant to such offering or the closing of such transaction, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series Preferred shall not
be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred until immediately prior to the closing of such
sale of securities or the closing of such transaction. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
after the Conversion Time, (i) issue and deliver to such holder of Series Preferred, or to his, her
or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and a certificate for the
number (if any) of the shares of Series Preferred represented by the surrendered certificate that
were not converted into Common Stock, (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Subsection
4.2 in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion
and (iii) pay all declared but unpaid dividends, if any, on the shares of Series Preferred
converted.

4.3.2 Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times
when the Series Preferred shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series Preferred,
such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Series Preferred; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Corporation shall take such
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without
limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an
adjustment reducing the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price below the then par value of
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred, the Corporation
will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of qualified Delaware counsel, be

necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series Preferred Conversion Price.

4.3.3, Effect of Conversion. All shares of Series Preferred which
shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at
the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise
issuable upon such conversion as provided in Subsection 4.2 and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon, if any. Any shares of Series Preferred so converted shall
be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation
may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series Preferred accordingly.

4.3.4 No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no
adjustment to the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be made for any declared
but unpaid dividends on the Series Preferred surrendered for conversion or on the Common
Stock delivered upon conversion.

4.3.5 Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and
other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of
Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred pursuant to this Section 4.3. The
Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other
than that in which the shares of Series Preferred so converted were registered, and no such
issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance
has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of
the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

44 Adjustments to Series Preferred Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

4.4.1 Special Definitions. For purposes of Part B of this Article
Fourth, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) “Option” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

Convertible Securities issued by reason of a
dividend, stock split, split-up or other
distribution on shares of Common Stock that is
covered by Subsection 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 or 4.8;

shares of Common Stock or Options issued to
employees or directors of, or consultants or

institutions, or to real property lessors,
pursuant to a debt financing, equipment
leasing or real property leasing transaction
approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, including at least one (1) Series
Preferred Director.

No Adjustment of Conversion Price. No adjustment in the

Series A Conversion Price shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock if the Corporation receives written notice from the holders
of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock agreeing that no such
adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock. No adjustment in the Series B Conversion Price shall be made as the

result of the issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if the
Corporation receives written notice from the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares
of Series B Preferred Stock (which majority must include the affirmative vote of the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock held by Greenspring) agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as
the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.

44.3 Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(a) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time
after the Series B Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities) or shall
fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any
such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of
the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date.

(b) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security,
the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4, are revised as a result of an amendment to such
terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security
(but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar
provisions of such Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or
decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion
and/or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in
the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange,
then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the applicable Series
Preferred Conversion Price computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible
Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised terms
been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this clause (b) shall have the effect
of increasing the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the
lower of (i) the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the
original adjustment made as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security, or
(ii) the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuances
of Additional Shares of Common Stock (other than deemed issuances of Additional Shares of
Common Stock as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security) between the
original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(c) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities), the

issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 (either because the consideration per share
(determined pursuant to Subsection 4.4.5) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject
thereto was equal to or greater than the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in
effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Series B Original
Issue Date), are revised after the Series B Original Issue Date as a result of an amendment to
such terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible
Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar
provisions of such Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any
such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease in the consideration payable to the
Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible
Security, as so amended or adjusted, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(determined in the manner provided in Subsection 4.4.3(a)) shall be deemed to have been issued
effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(d) Upon the expiration or termination of any
unexercised Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof)
which resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment
to the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4, the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such Series Preferred
Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible Security (or portion
thereof) never been issued.

(e) If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is
calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to
adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price provided for in this Subsection 4.4.3 shall be effected at the time of such
issuance or amendment based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without
regard to any provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be
treated as provided in clauses (b) and (c) of this Subsection 4.4.3). If the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or
Convertible Security, or the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise,
conversion and/or exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option or Convertible
Security is issued or amended, any adjustment to the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price that would result under the terms of this Subsection 4.4.3 at the time of such issuance or
amendment shall instead be effected at the time such number of shares and/or amount of
consideration is first calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for
purposes of calculating such adjustment to such Series Preferred Conversion Price that such
issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first be made.

4.4.4 Adjustment of Series Preferred Conversion Price Upon
Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time
after the Series B Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including

Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3), without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the
nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

CP2 =CP1* (A+B) +(A+C).
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) “CP2” shall mean the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock

(b) “CP1” shall mean the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common
Stock;

(c) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock
(treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Options outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities (including the Series Preferred) outstanding (assuming exercise of any
outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);

(d) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued
at a price per share equal to CP1 (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received
by the Corporation in respect of such issue by CP1); and

(e) “C” shall mean the number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction.

4.4.5 Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4.4, the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(a) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(i) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed
at the aggregate amount of cash received by
the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or
payable for accrued interest;

(ii) insofar as it consists of property other than
cash, be computed at the fair market value
thereof at the time of such issue, as determined

in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation; and

in the event Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued together with other shares or
securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the
proportion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)
above, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(b) Options and Convertible Securities. The
consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3, relating to Options and Convertible
Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

(i)

(ii)

18

the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Corporation as consideration
for the issue of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate
amount of additional consideration (as set
forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or
in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment
of such number) issuable upon the exercise of
such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, or in the case of
Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible
Securities and the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities.

4.4.6 Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall
issue on more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one
transaction or a series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the
applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Subsection 4.4.4 and such
issuance dates occur within a period of no more than 90 days from the first such issuance to the
final such issuance, then, upon the final such issuance, the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the
date of the first such issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result
of any such subsequent issuances within such period).

4.5 Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date effect a subdivision
of the outstanding Common Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect
immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased
in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the applicable Series Preferred Conversion
Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding. Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

4.6 Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect
immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date, and

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance
or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
in payment of such dividend or distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable
Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on
such record date and thereafter the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted

pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions;
and (b) that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Series Preferred simultaneously
receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of
Series Preferred had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

47 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series B Original Issue Date shall make or
issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution
of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other
property and the provisions of Section 1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and
in each such event the holders of Series Preferred shall receive, simultaneously with the
distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities
or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they
would have received if all outstanding shares of Series Preferred had been converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event.

48 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the
provisions of Subsection 2.3, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock
(but not the Series Preferred) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
(other than a transaction covered by Subsections 4.4, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Series
Preferred shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was
convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon
conversion of one share of Series Preferred immediately prior to such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive
pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the
provisions in this Section 3.4.1 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of
the Series Preferred, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 3.4.1 (including
provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to
any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series
Preferred. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Subsection 4.8 shall be construed as
preventing the holders of Series Preferred from seeking any appraisal rights to which they are
otherwise entitled under the General Corporation Law in connection with a merger triggering an
adjustment hereunder, nor shall this Subsection 4.8 be deemed conclusive evidence of the fair
value of the shares of Series Preferred in any such appraisal proceeding.

4.9 Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
cr readjustment of the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price pursuant to this Section
3.4.1, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event
not later than 10 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with

the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Series Preferred a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
into which the Series Preferred is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series Preferred (but in any
event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the applicable Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii)
the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or
property which then would be received upon the conversion of Series Preferred.

4.10 Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of
its Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the
Series Preferred) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other
distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any
class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

(b) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any
reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

(c) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up of the Corporation,

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Series Preferred a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be
fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred) shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities
or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such
exchange applicable to the Series Preferred and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at
least 10 days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

5.1 Trigger Events. Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of
Common Stock to the public, in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with a pre money
valuation of the Corporation (on a fully diluted basis) of at least $300,000,000 and resulting in at
least $75,000,000 of gross proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and commissions, to the
Corporation or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written
consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred (provided

that no conversion election pursuant to this clause (b) shall be effective as to the Series B
Preferred Stock unless approved by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Series B
Preferred Stock (which majority must include the affirmative vote of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock held by Greenspring)) (the time of such closing or the date and time specified or
the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent is referred to herein as the
“Mandatory Conversion Time”), (i) all outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate
and (ii) such shares of Series Preferred may not be reissued by the Corporation.

5.2 Procedural Requirements. All holders of record of shares of Series
Preferred shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series Preferred pursuant to this
Section 5. Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory
Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Series Preferred shall
surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that
such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the
Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written
instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All
rights with respect to the Series Preferred converted pursuant to Subsection 5.1, including the
rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will
terminate at the Mandatory Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or
holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the
holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and
agreement) therefor, to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Subsection
5.2. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and the surrender of the
certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Series Preferred, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in
accordance with the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in Subsection 4.2 in lieu of
any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the
payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred converted. Such
converted Series Preferred shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of
such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need
for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series
Preferred accordingly.

6. Redemption

6.1 General. Unless prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to
stockholders, shares of Series Preferred shall be redeemed by the Corporation at a price equal to
the applicable Series Preferred Original Issue Price per share, plus all declared but unpaid
dividends thereon, if any, (the “Redemption Price”), in three annual installments (without

interest) commencing not more than 60 days after receipt by the Corporation at any time on or
after five (5) years after the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
from the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred, of written
notice requesting redemption of all shares of Series Preferred (the “Redemption Request”).

Upon receipt of a Redemption Request, the Corporation shall apply all of its assets to any such
redemption, and to no other corporate purpose, except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law
governing distributions to stockholders. The date of each such installment shall be referred to as
a “Redemption Date”. On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata
basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series Preferred owned by each holder, that
number of outstanding shares of Series Preferred determined by dividing (i) the total number of
shares of Series Preferred outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the
number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such
calculation applies); provided, however, that Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in
Subsection 6.2) shall not be redeemed and shall be excluded from the calculations set forth in
this sentence. If on any Redemption Date Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders
prevents the Corporation from redeeming all shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed, then (y)
first, the Corporation shall redeem ratably from the holders of Series B Preferred Stock such
number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as the Corporation shall have funds legally
available therefor and shall redeem the remainder of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock
immediately as assets or funds become legally available therefor until the aggregate Redemption
Price for the Series B Preferred Stock is paid in full and (z) second, after the aggregate
Redemption Price for the Series B Preferred Stock has been paid in full, the Corporation shall
redeem ratably from the holders of Series A Preferred Stock such number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock as the Corporation shall have funds legally available therefor and shall redeem
the remainder of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately as assets or funds become
legally available therefor until the aggregate Redemption Price for the Series A Preferred Stock
is paid in full.

6.2 Redemption Notice. The Corporation shall send written notice of the
mandatory redemption (the “Redemption Notice”) to each holder of record of Series Preferred
not less than 40 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

(a) the number of shares of Series Preferred held by the
holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption
Notice;

(b) the Redemption Date and the applicable Redemption
Price;
(c) the date upon which the holder’s right to convert

such shares terminates (as determined in accordance with Subsection 4.1); and

(d) that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the
shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed.

If the Corporation receives, on or prior to the 20th day after the date of delivery of the
Redemption Notice to a holder of Series Preferred, written notice from such holder that such
holder elects to be excluded from the redemption provided in this Section 6, then the shares of
Series Preferred registered on the books of the Corporation in the name of such holder at the time
of the Corporation’s receipt of such notice shall thereafter be “Excluded Shares.” Excluded
Shares shall not be redeemed or redeemable pursuant to this Section 6, whether on such
Redemption Date or thereafter.

6.3 Surrender of Certificates: Payment. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed on such Redemption
Date, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in
Section 3.4.1, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares (or, if such
registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in
the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to
the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner
thereof. In the event less than all of the shares of Series Preferred represented by a certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Series Preferred shall
promptly be issued to such holder.

6.4 Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Series Preferred to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or
tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available
therefor in a timely manner, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the
shares of Series Preferred so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends
with respect to such shares of Series Preferred shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date
and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate,
except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

7. Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Series Preferred that are
redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be
automatically and immediately cancelled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or
transferred. Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other
rights granted to the holders of Series Preferred following redemption.

8. Waiver. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of the Series A
Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived on behalf of all holders of Series A Preferred
Stock by the affirmative written consent or vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other
terms of the Series B Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived on behalf of all holders of
Series B Preferred Stock by the affirmative written consent or vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding.

9. Notices. Any notice required or permitted by the provisions of this Article Fourth
to be given to a holder of shares of Series Preferred shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the post
office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given by electronic
communication in compliance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law, and shall be
deemed sent upon such mailing or electronic transmission.

FIFTH: Subject to any additional vote required by this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, in furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, repeal, alter, amend
and rescind any or all of the Bylaws of the Corporation.

SIXTH: Subject to any additional vote required by this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the number of directors of the Corporation shall be determined in
the manner set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

SEVENTH: Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

EIGHTH: Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware, as the Bylaws of the Corporation may provide. The books of the Corporation may be
kept outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to
time by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

NINTH: To the fullest extent permitted by law, a director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the General Corporation Law or any other law of the
State of Delaware is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article Ninth to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then
the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the General Corporation Law as so amended.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article Ninth by
the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director
of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director of the
Corporation with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to, such repeal
or modification.

TENTH: The following indemnification provisions shall apply to the persons
enumerated below.

1. Right to Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently
exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an “Indemnified Person”) who was or is made
or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact
that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a

director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise or
nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and
loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Person in such Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise
provided in Section 3 of this Article Tenth, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an
Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such
Indemnified Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the
Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

2. Advancement of Expenses of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall
advance (i.e., pay in advance) the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an
Indemnified Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided,
however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final
disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an unsecured undertaking by
the Indemnified Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that
the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article Tenth or otherwise.

3. Claims by Directors and Officers. If a claim for indemnification or advancement
of expenses under this Article Tenth is not paid in full within 30 days after a written claim
therefor by the Indemnified Person has been received by the Corporation, the Indemnified Person
may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part,
shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to the
requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.

4. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may (but shall not
be required to) indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is made or is
threatened to be made or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such
person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was an employee or
agent of the Corporation or, while an employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or
of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered
and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
such Proceeding. The ultimate determination of entitlement to indemnification of persons who
are non-director or officer employees or agents shall be made in such manner as is determined by
the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the
Corporation shall not be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding initiated
by such person if the Proceeding was not authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

5. Advancement of Expenses of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may (but
shall not be required to) pay the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an employee or
agent in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition on such terms and
conditions as may be determined by the Board of Directors.

6. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Article
Tenth shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

7. Other Indemnification. The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any
person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer or employee of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, organization or other
enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such
other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, organization or
other enterprise.

8. Insurance. The Board of Directors may, to the full extent permitted by applicable
law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be amended from time to time, authorize an
appropriate officer or officers to purchase and maintain at the Corporation's expense insurance:
(a) to indemnify the Corporation for any obligation which it incurs as a result of the
indemnification of directors, officers and employees under the provisions of this Article Tenth;
and (6) to indemnify or insure directors, officers and employees against liability in instances in
which they may not otherwise be indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this
Article Tenth.

9. Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of
this Article Tenth shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in
respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. The
rights provided hereunder shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and such person's
heirs, executors and administrators.

ELEVENTH: The Corporation renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate
in, any Excluded Opportunity. An “Excluded Opportunity” is any matter, transaction or
interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into
the possession of, (i) any director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) any holder of Series Preferred or any partner, member, director,
stockholder, employee or agent of any such holder, other than someone who is an employee of
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Covered Persons”), unless such matter,
transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes
into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person’s capacity
as a director of the Corporation.

TWELFTH: For purposes of Section 500 of the California Corporations Code
(to the extent applicable), in connection with any repurchase of shares of Common Stock
permitted under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation from employees,
officers, directors or consultants of the Company in connection with a termination of
employment or services pursuant to agreements or arrangements approved by the Board of
Directors (in addition to any other consent required under this Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation), such repurchase may be made without regard to any “preferential dividends

arrears amount” or “preferential rights amount” (as those terms are defined in Section 500 of the
California Corporations Code). Accordingly, for purposes of making any calculation under
California Corporations Code Section 500 in connection with such repurchase, the amount of any
“preferential dividends arrears amount” or “preferential rights amount” (as those terms are
defined therein) shall be deemed to be zero (0).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation has been executed by a duly authorized officer of this corporation on this 19th day
of August, 2015.
