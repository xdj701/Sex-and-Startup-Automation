B. Rights, Preferences and Restrictions of Preferred Stock. The rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set forth below in
this Article IV(B).

1. Dividend Provisions.

(a) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration
or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Series A Common Stock, Series B Common
Stock, Series C Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the
holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Series A Common Stock,
Series B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock of this corporation) on the Series A

Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock of this corporation, at the
applicable Dividend Rate (as defined below), payable when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors of this corporation (the “Board of Directors”). The holders of the outstanding
Preferred Stock can waive any dividend preference that such holders shall be entitled to receive
under this Section | upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as
separate series, and on an as-converted basis) (the “Requisite Investor Threshold”). For purposes
of this subsection 1(a), “Dividend Rate” shall mean eight percent (8%) of the applicable Original
Issue Price per annum for each share of Preferred Stock (each as adjusted for any stock splits,
stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such
series of Preferred Stock).

(b) After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends or
distributions shall be distributed among all holders of Series A Common Stock, Series B
Common Stock, Series C Common Stock and Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of
shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock and Series C Common Stock that
would be held by each such holder if all shares of Preferred Stock were converted to Series A
Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate (as defined below).

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below), either
voluntary or involuntary, the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
out of the proceeds or assets of this corporation available for distribution to its stockholders (the
“Proceeds”), prior and in preference to any distribution of the Proceeds of such Liquidation
Event to the holders of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common
Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of the
applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below) for such series of Preferred Stock, plus
declared but unpaid dividends on such share. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the Proceeds
thus distributed among the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire Proceeds
legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred
Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive under this subsection (a). For purposes of this Eleventh Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the “Restated Certificate”), “Original Issue Price” shall mean (i)
with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, the original price per share paid to this corporation
by check, wire transfer, cancellation of indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the
Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with a written agreement with this corporation setting
forth the purchase price per share of such Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) with respect to the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock, the original price per share paid to this corporation by check, wire transfer,

Stock in accordance with a written agreement with this corporation setting forth the purchase
price per share of such Series A-1 Preferred Stock, (iii) with respect to the Series AA Preferred
Stock, the original price per share paid to this corporation by check, wire transfer, cancellation of
indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the Series AA Preferred Stock in

share of such Series AAA Preferred Stock, (v) with respect to the Series A4 Preferred Stock, the
original price per share paid to this corporation by check, wire transfer, cancellation of
indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the Series A4 Preferred Stock in
accordance with a written agreement with this corporation setting forth the purchase price per
share of such Series A4 Preferred Stock, (vi) with respect to the Series A5 Preferred Stock, the
original price per share paid to this corporation by check, wire transfer, cancellation of
indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the Series AS Preferred Stock in
accordance with a written agreement with this corporation setting forth the purchase price per
share of such Series A5 Preferred Stock, (vii) with respect to the Series A6 Preferred Stock, the

accordance with a written agreement with this corporation setting forth the purchase price per
share of such Series A6 Preferred Stock, (viii) with respect to the Series A7 Preferred Stock, the
original price per share paid to this corporation by check, wire transfer, cancellation of
indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the Series A7 Preferred Stock in

original price per share paid to this corporation by check, wire transfer, cancellation of
indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the Series A8 Preferred Stock in

indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the Series AA-9 Preferred Stock in
accordance with a written agreement with this corporation setting forth the purchase price per
share of such Series AA-9 Preferred Stock, (xi) with respect to the Series A9 Preferred Stock, the
original price per share paid to this corporation by check, wire transfer, cancellation of
indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the Series A9 Preferred Stock in

the original price per share paid to this corporation by check, wire transfer, cancellation of
indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing for the Series Al0 Preferred Stock in
accordance with a written agreement with this corporation (the “Al0 Purchase Agreement”)
setting forth the purchase price per share of such Series A10 Preferred Stock (each as adjusted
for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like
with respect to such series of Preferred Stock).

(b) | Upon completion of the distribution required by subsection (a) of
this Section 2, all of the remaining Proceeds available for distribution to stockholders shall be
distributed among the holders of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock and Series C
Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B
Common Stock and Series C Common Stock held by each.

(c) Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of determining the
amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with respect to a

Liquidation Event, each such holder of shares of a series of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to
have converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares of
such series into shares of Series A Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event if,
as a result of an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount
greater than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such holder did not convert
such series of Preferred Stock into shares of Series A Common Stock. If any such holder shall
be deemed to have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Series A Common Stock pursuant to
this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would
otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been
deemed to have converted) into shares of Series A Common Stock.

qd (i) For purposes of this Section 2, a “Liquidation Event” shall
include (A) the closing of the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of this corporation’s
assets (including, without limitation, the sale or disposition (whether by merger or otherwise) of
one or more subsidiaries of this corporation if substantially all of the assets of this corporation
are held by such subsidiary or subsidiaries), (B) the consummation of the merger or
consolidation of this corporation with or into another entity or of a subsidiary of this corporation
which is a constituent party and this corporation issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such
merger or consolidation (except a merger or consolidation in which the holders of capital stock
of this corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least
50% of the voting power of the capital stock of (i) this corporation or the surviving or resulting
entity or (ii) if the surviving or resulting entity is a wholly-owned subsidiary of another
corporation immediately following such merger or consolidations, the parent corporation of such
surviving or resulting corporation), (C) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or
group of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of this corporation’s securities), of this
corporation’s securities if, after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons would
hold 50% or more of the outstanding voting stock of this corporation (or the surviving or
acquiring entity) or (D) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this corporation; provided,
however, that a transaction shall not constitute a Liquidation Event if its sole purpose is to
change the state of this corporation’s incorporation or to create a holding company that will be
owned in the same proportions by the persons who held this corporation’s securities immediately
prior to such transaction. The treatment of any particular transaction or series of related
transactions as a Liquidation Event may be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders
of (i) as to all series of Preferred Stock other than the Series A5 Preferred Stock, Series A6
Preferred Stock, Series A7 Preferred Stock, Series A8 Preferred Stock, Series AA-9 Preferred
Stock, Series A9 Preferred Stock and Series A10 Preferred Stock, a majority of the shares of
Preferred Stock (other than shares of Series AS Preferred Stock, Series A6 Preferred Stock,
Series A7 Preferred Stock, Series A8 Preferred Stock, Series AA-9 Preferred Stock, Series A9
Preferred Stock and Series A10 Preferred Stock) then outstanding (voting together as a single
class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis), (ii) solely with respect to the
Series A5 Preferred Stock, a majority of the shares of Series A5 Preferred Stock then
outstanding, voting as a separate class, (iii) solely with respect to the Series A6 Preferred Stock,
a majority of the shares of Series A6 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class,
(iv) solely with respect to the Series A7 Preferred Stock, a majority of the shares of Series A7
Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class, (v) solely with respect to the Series

A8 Preferred Stock, at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the shares of Series A8 Preferred Stock
then outstanding, voting as a separate class, (vi) solely with respect to the IX Preferred, a
majority of the shares of [X Preferred then outstanding, voting together as a single class and not
as separate series, and on an as-converted basis, and (vii) solely with respect to the Series A10
Preferred Stock, a majority of the shares of Series A10 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting
as a separate class.

(ii) In any Liquidation Event, if Proceeds received by this
corporation or its stockholders are other than cash, their value will be deemed their fair market
value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over
the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over
the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the closing of the
Liquidation Event; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors and the holders constituting the Requisite Investor Threshold.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually deteiimined in good faith by the Board of
Directors and holders constituting the Requisite Investor Threshold.

(C) _ If the Board of Directors and holders constituting
the Requisite Investor Threshold cannot in good faith determine the fair market value to be
determined pursuant to Sections 2(d)(ii)(A)(3) or 2(d)(ii)(B) of this Article [V(B) within fifteen
(15) days of the Liquidation Event, the Board of Directors shall retain for such purposes an
independent national accounting firm as a neutral and independent party (the “Independent
Accountant”). If the Independent Accountant is retained, then within twenty (20) days the
Independent Accountant render its decision as to the applicable fair market value, which decision
shall be final and binding on, and nonappealable by, all parties hereto. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountant shall be paid by this corporation.

(D) The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash

consideration to be distributed in connection with a Liquidation Event shall, with the appropriate
approval of the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation Event by the stockholders

under the General Corporation Law and Section 6 of this Article 1V(B), be superseded by the
determination of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Liquidation
Event.

(iti) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not
complied with, this corporation shall forthwith either:

(A) _ cause the closing of such Liquidation Event to be
postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(d){iv) hereof.

(iv) This corporation shall give each holder of record of
Preferred Stock written notice of such impending Liquidation Event not later than twenty (20)
days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days
prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in
writing of the final approval of such transaction, which approval shall not be effective without
first obtaining the approval of holders constituting the Requisite Investor Threshold, as described
in Section 6 of this Article [V(B). The first of such notices shall describe the material teiins and
conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and this corporation
shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in
no event take place sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation has given the first notice
provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after this corporation has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that subject to compliance with the
General Corporation Law such periods may be shortened or waived upon the written consent of
the holders of Preferred Stock that constitute the Requisite Investor Threshold.

(e) Allocation of Contingent Consideration. In the event of a deemed
Liquidation Event pursuant to subsection 2(d)(i), if any portion of the consideration payable to
the stockholders of this corporation is subject to contingencies (the “Additional Consideration”),
the definitive agreement with respect to such deemed Liquidation Event shall provide that (a) the
portion of such consideration that is not subject to any contingencies (the “Initial Consideration”)
shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of this corporation in accordance with
subsections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable
in connection with such deemed Liquidation Event and (b) any Additional Consideration that
becomes payable to the stockholders of this corporation upon satisfaction of contingencies shall
be allocated among the holders of capital stock of this corporation in accordance with
subsections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) after taking into account the previous payment of the Initial
Consideration as part of the same transaction. For purposes of this subsection (e), consideration
placed into escrow or retained as holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or
similar obligations in connection with such Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be Additional
Consideration.

3. Redemption. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable at the option of the
holder thereof.

4. Conversion. The Preferred Stock may convert to Common Stock as
follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, at the office of
this corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Series A Common Stock as is determined by dividing the applicable
Original Issue Price for such series by the applicable Conversion Price for such series (the
conversion rate for a series of Preferred Stock into Series A Common Stock is referred to herein
as the “Conversion Rate” for such series), determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date
the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The initial “Conversion Price” per share for each
series of Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to such series; provided,
however, that the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set
forth in subsection 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Subject to subsection 4(b)(ii) below in respect of the Series
A8 Preferred Stock and subsection 4(b)(iii) below in respect of the Series A10 Preferred Stock,
each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Series A Common
Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such series of Preferred Stock (and such
shares may not be reissued by this corporation) immediately upon the earlier of (x) the closing
of this corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Act”), resulting in at least $200,000,000 of gross proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and
commissions, to this corporation (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (y) the date, or the
occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent or agreement of holders constituting
(A) as to all series of Legacy Preferred Stock other than Series A8 Preferred Stock, a majority of
the shares of Legacy Preferred Stock (other than shares of Series A8 Preferred Stock) then
outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted
basis); provided, however, that, with respect to the automatic conversion of Series A5 Preferred
Stock, Series A6 Preferred Stock or Series A7 Preferred Stock pursuant to subsection
A(b)(i)(y)(A), (1) if the automatic conversion of shares of Series AS Preferred Stock is in
connection with a Liquidation Event wherein the Proceeds to which the holders of Series AS
Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to the conversion of such shares of Series A5
Preferred Stock into Common Stock and payment to them as holders of Common Stock in such
Liquidation Event would be lower than the Proceeds such holders would otherwise have been
entitled to receive in exchange for their shares of Series A5 Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2
of Article IV(B) hereof if no shares of Series A5 Preferred Stock were converted to Common
Stock, then the approval, by vote or written consent, of holders of a majority of the shares of
Series A5 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class, shall also be required for
the conversion of Series A5 Preferred Stock; (2) if the automatic conversion of shares of Series
A6 Preferred Stock is in connection with a Liquidation Event wherein the Proceeds to which the

holders of Series A6 Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to the conversion of such shares
of Series A6 Preferred Stock into Common Stock and payment to them as holders of Common
Stock in such Liquidation Event would be lower than the Proceeds such holders would otherwise
have been entitled to receive in exchange for their shares of Series A6 Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section 2 of Article IV(B) hereof if no shares of Series A6 Preferred Stock were converted to
Common Stock, then the approval, by vote or written consent, of holders of a majority of the
shares of Series A6 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class, shall also be
required for the conversion of Series A6 Preferred Stock; and (3) if the automatic conversion of
shares of Series A7 Preferred Stock is in connection with a Liquidation Event wherein the
Proceeds to which the holders of Series A7 Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to the
conversion of such shares of Series A7 Preferred Stock into Common Stock and payment to
them as holders of Common Stock in such Liquidation Event would be lower than the Proceeds
such holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive in exchange for their shares of Series
AT Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2 of Article IV(B) hereof if no shares of Series A7
Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock, then the approval, by vote or written consent,
of holders of a majority of the shares of Series A7 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a
separate class, shall also be required for the conversion of Series A7 Preferred Stock; (B) solely
with respect to the conversion of the Series A8 Preferred Stock, at least sixty-five percent (65%)
of the shares of Series A8 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class; (C) solely
with respect to the conversion of the IX Preferred, a majority of the shares of IX Preferred then
outstanding, voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis; and (D) solely with
respect to the conversion of the Series A10 Preferred Stock, a majority of the shares of Series
A10 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class.

(ii) | Notwithstanding subsection 4(b)({i) above, unless waived
by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the shares of
Series A8 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class, in the event of a
conversion of Preferred Stock pursuant to a Qualified Public Offering in clause (x) of subsection
4(b)(i) in which the initial public offering price to the public set forth on the cover of the
registration statement for the Qualified Public Offering (the “Qualified Offering Price”) is less
than the Conversion Price then in effect for the Series A8 Preferred Stock, the Conversion Rate
of the Series A8 Preferred Stock shall automatically be adjusted to a Conversion Rate that would
provide for, as of the closing of the Qualified Public Offering, each holder of Series A8 Preferred
Stock to receive on conversion of such holder’s shares of Series A8 Preferred Stock, a number of
shares of Common Stock with an aggregate value (with such value calculated based on the
Qualified Offering Price) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Series A8 Preferred
Stock held by such holder that are converted into shares of Common Stock in connection with
the Qualified Public Offering multiplied by (y) the Original Issue Price of the Series A8
Preferred Stock.

(iii) | Notwithstanding subsection 4(b)({i) above, unless waived
by the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A10 Preferred
Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class, in the event of a conversion of Preferred Stock
pursuant to a Qualified Public Offering in clause (x) of subsection 4(b)(i) in which the Qualified
Offering Price is less than the Conversion Price then in effect for the Series A10 Preferred Stock,
the Conversion Price of the Series A10 Preferred Stock shall automatically be adjusted as of
immediately prior to the closing of such Qualified Public Offering by assuming (solely as to the

Series A10 Preferred Stock) that the shares to be issued by the Company in such Qualified Public
Offering are shares of “Additional Stock” (as defined in subsection 4(d)(ii)) issued as of
immediately prior to the conversion of the Series A10 Preferred Stock, such that the provisions
of subsection 4(d)(i) shall apply in respect of the shares issued in such Qualified Public Offering.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
voluntarily convert the same into shares of Series A Common Stock, he, she or it shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed (or if such holder alleges that any such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably
acceptable to this corporation to indemnify this corporation against any claim that may be made
against this corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at
the principal office of this corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, together
with written notice of the election to convert all or any number of the shares of Preferred Stock
represented by such certificate or certificates, any event on which such conversion is contingent
(if applicable) and the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Series
A Common Stock are to be issued. This corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, (i)
issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees
of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series A Common Stock to
which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a certificate for the number (if any) of the
shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate or certificates that were not
converted into Series A Common Stock and (ii) pay all declared but unpaid dividends for the
applicable Preferred Stock which is being converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date set forth for conversion in the
written notice of the election to convert irrespective of the surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Series A
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Series A Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is
in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Act, the
conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such
offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Series A Common Stock upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock
until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. If the conversion is in
connection with automatic conversion provisions of subsection 4(b)(ii) and/or 4(b)(iii), such
conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the conversion date described in the
stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of
Series A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holders of such shares of Series A Common Stock as of such date.

(ii) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
sent written notice of the Automatic Conversion Time and the place designated for automatic
conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. Such notice need not
be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Automatic Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such
notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or

certificates for all such shares (or if such holder alleges that any such certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to this
corporation to indemnify this corporation against any claim that may be made against this
corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to this
corporation at the place designated in such notice. This corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, (i) issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee
or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series A
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a certificate for the
number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate or
certificates that were not converted into Series A Common Stock and (ii) pay all declared but
unpaid dividends for the applicable Preferred Stock which is being converted. Such conversion
shall be deemed to have been made on the Automatic Conversion Date, and the persons entitled
to receive shares of Series A Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Date
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holders of such shares of Series A Common Stock
as of such date.

(iii) Such converted Preferred Stock shall be retired and
cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and this corporation may thereafter
take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to
reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances. Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall
be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If this corporation shall issue, on or after the date upon
which this Restated Certificate is accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or
for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price applicable to a series of Preferred
Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price
for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as
otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price (calculated to the nearest one-
hundredth of one cent) deteimined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined
below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Series A Common Stock
that the aggregate consideration received by this corporation for such issuance would purchase at
such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of such Additional Stock. For purposes of this Section 4(d)(i)(A), the term “Common
Stock Outstanding” shall mean and include the following: (1) outstanding Series A Common
Stock, Series B Common Stock and Series C Common Stock, (2) Series A Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock, (3) Series A Common Stock, Series B
Common Stock and Series C Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options
and (4) Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock and Series C Common Stock issuable
upon exercise (and, in the case of warrants to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of
outstanding warrants. Shares described in (1) through (4) above shall be included whether
vested or unvested, whether contingent or non-contingent and whether exercisable or not yet

exercisable. In the event that this corporation issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold,
shares of Additional Stock that results in an adjustment to a Conversion Price pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 4(d) (the “First Dilutive Issuance”), and this corporation then issues or
sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, shares of Additional Stock in a subsequent issuance
other than the First Dilutive Issuance that would result in further adjustment to a Conversion
Price (a “Subsequent Dilutive Issuance”) pursuant to the same instruments as the First Dilutive
Issuance, then and in each such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance the applicable
Conversion Price for the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced to the applicable
Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each
Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the
Preferred Stock shall be made in an amount less than one hundredth of one cent per share.
Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)(i)(E)(4), no
adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor, excluding
amounts paid or payable for accrued interest.

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock
for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as deteiinined in good faith by the Board of Directors
irrespective of any accounting treatment.

(E) Inthe case of the issuance of options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common
Stock, securities by their teiins convertible into or exchangeable for Series A Common Stock,
Series B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe
for such convertible or exchangeable securities (“Common Stock Equivalents”), the following
provisions shall apply for purposes of determining the number of shares of Additional Stock
issued and the consideration paid therefor:

(1) ‘The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock deliverable
upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, including without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) of such Common Stock Equivalents shall be deemed to have been issued at the time
such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined
in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and 4(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this
corporation upon the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents plus the minimum exercise
price provided in such Common Stock Equivalents (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) for the Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C
Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility
or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible or exchangeable securities
or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have
been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by this corporation for any such
securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received
by this corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and

4(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock
deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation upon exercise of such options or
rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the
Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using
such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common
Stock or Series C Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any
such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(4) Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the teiimination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the
Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the
issuance of only the number of shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or
Series C Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.

(5) The number of shares of Additional Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1)
and (2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, teiinination or expiration of the type
described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4).

(ii) | “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Series A
Common Stock, Series B Common Stock, or Series C Common Stock issued (or deemed to have
been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)) by this corporation on or after the Filing Date
other than:

(A) Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock
or Series C Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in subsection 4(d)(iii)
hereof;

(B) Series A Common Stock issued or issuable to
employees, directors, consultants and other service providers for the primary purpose of
soliciting or retaining their services pursuant to plans or agreements approved by the Board of
Directors;

(C) Except as provided in subsection 4(b)(ii) as to the
Series A8 Preferred Stock and subsection 4(b)(iii) as to the Series A10 Preferred Stock, Series A
Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock issued pursuant to, or in
connection with, an underwritten public offering (it being understood that, for the avoidance of
doubt, Additional Stock shall not include any shares issued or deemed to be issued as a result of
an increase in the Conversion Rate of the Series A8 Preferred Stock resulting from the operation
of subsection 4(b)(ii) or as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of the Series A10
Preferred Stock resulting from the operation of subsection 4(b)(iii));

(D) Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock
or Series C Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the conversion or exercise of
convertible or exercisable securities outstanding on the Filing Date;

(E) Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock
or Series C Common Stock issued in connection with a bona fide business acquisition by this
corporation, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or
otherwise, which issuance is approved by the Board of Directors;

(F) Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock
or Series C Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E) as a result
of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock resulting from the
operation of Section 4(d);

(G) Series A Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of Preferred Stock issued on or after the date hereof;

(H) — Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock
or Series C Common Stock issued pursuant to any equipment leasing arrangement or debt
financing arrangement, which arrangement is approved by the Board of Directors;

(69) Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock
or Series C Common Stock issued to persons or entities with which this corporation has business
relationships, provided such issuances are approved by the Board of Directors and are primarily
for non-equity financing purposes;

() Series A Common Stock issued upon conversion of
any Series B Common Stock in accordance with Section (C)(5) of Article IV;

(K) Series A Common Stock issued upon conversion of
any Series C Common Stock in accordance with Section (C)(5) of Article IV; or

(L) Series A Common Stock issued as a dividend on the
Preferred Stock (such issuances listed in (A) through (L) hereof collectively referred to as
“Excluded Issuances”).

(iii) In the event this corporation should at any time or from
time to time after the Filing Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of
the outstanding shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C
Common Stock or the determination of holders of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common
Stock or Series C Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
additional shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common
Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such holder for
the additional shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common
Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Series A Common
Stock, Series B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise
thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or
subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be
proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Series A Common Stock issuable on
conversion of each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall be increased in proportion to
such increase of the aggregate number of shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common
Stock or Series C Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common
Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common Stock Equivalents
determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in subsection
4(d)(i)(E); provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend is not paid or if
such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price for such series
of Preferred Stock will be re-computed accordingly as of the close of business on such record
date and thereafter each such Conversion Price will be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4(d)(iii)
to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

(iv) If the number of shares of Series A Common Stock, Series
B Common Stock or Series C Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Filing Date is
decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B
Common Stock or Series C Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination,
the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number
of shares of Series A Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) | Other Distributions. In the event this corporation shall declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this
corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in subsection 4(d)(iii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution
as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Series A Common Stock of this
corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed

for the determination of the holders of Series A Common Stock of this corporation entitled to
receive such distribution.

(f) Merger or Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time
there shall be a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger in
which the Series A Common Stock (but not the Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged
for securities, cash, or other property (other than a transaction provided for elsewhere in this
Section 4 or in Section 2) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the number and kind of
shares of stock or other securities, cash or property to which a holder of the number of shares of
Series A Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of one share of such series of Preferred
Stock immediately prior to such recapitalization would have been entitled on such
recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after
the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the
Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalently as may be practicable.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this subsection (f) shall be construed as preventing the
holders of Preferred Stock from seeking any appraisal rights to which they are otherwise entitled
under the General Corporation Law in connection with a merger triggering an adjustment
hereunder, nor shall this subsection (f) be deemed conclusive evidence of the fair value of the
shares of Preferred Stock in any such appraisal proceeding.

(g) No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments.

(i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of the Preferred Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Series A
Common Stock to be issued to particular stockholders, shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole share and this corporation shall pay in cash the fair market value of any fractional shares
as of the time when entitlement to receive such fractions is mutually determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors and the holders constituting the Requisite Investor Threshold. Whether or
not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of
the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Series A
Common Stock and the number of shares of Series A Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, this corporation,
at its expense, shall promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event not later than 15 days
thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of each applicable series of Preferred Stock a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash
or other property into which the Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. This corporation shall, as promptly as
practicable upon the written request at any time of any holder of any series of Preferred Stock
(but in any event not later than 15 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such
holder a like certificate setting forth (A) the Conversion Price for each applicable series of

Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (B) the number of shares of Series A Common Stock
and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion
of a share of each applicable series of Preferred Stock.

(h) Notices of Record Date. In the event (i) of any taking by this
corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any
right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or any other securities,
or to receive any other security, or (ii) of any capital reorganization of this corporation, any
reclassification of Common Stock, or any Liquidation Event, this corporation shall mail to each
holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice
specifying the (x) date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend
or distribution, and the amount and character of such dividend or distribution or (y) the effective
date on which such reorganization, reclassification or Liquidation Event is proposed to take
place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or
such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
or Liquidation Event, and the amount per share and character of such exchange applicable to the
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock.

(i) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This corporation
shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Series A
Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred
Stock, such number of its shares of Series A Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any
time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Series A Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in
addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, this
corporation will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Series A Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for
such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

(j) Waiver of Adjustment to Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (i) any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any
series of Legacy Preferred Stock may be waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either
generally or in a particular instance, by the consent or vote of holders of a majority of the shares
of Legacy Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as separate
series, and on an as-converted basis); provided, however, that any downward adjustment of the
Conversion Price of the Series A8 Preferred Stock pursuant to Article [V(B), Section 4(b)(ii)
may only be waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least sixty-five percent
(65%) of the shares of Series A8 Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting as a separate class, (ii)
any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of IX Preferred may be waived,
either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance, by the
consent or vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IX Preferred then outstanding (voting
together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-converted basis); provided,

however, that if a downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of the Series AA-9 Preferred
Stock is waived in accordance with this subsection 4(j)(ii), then any downward adjustment of the
Conversion Price of the Series A9 Preferred Stock shall also be automatically waived, and (iii)
any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of the Series A10 Preferred Stock may be
waived, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance, by
the consent or vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Series A10 Preferred Stock then
outstanding, voting as a separate class. Any such waiver shall bind all future holders of shares of
such series of Preferred Stock.

5. Voting Rights.

(a) General Voting Rights. The holder of each share of Preferred
Stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of Series A Common Stock into which such
Preferred Stock could be converted as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
vote on such matter, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and
powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Series A Common Stock, and
shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of this corporation, and except as provided by law or in subsection
5(b) below with respect to the election of directors by the separate class vote of the holders of
Series A Common Stock and Series B Common Stock (voting together as a single class and not
as separate series), shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Series A Common Stock and
Series B Common Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series), with
respect to any question upon which holders of Series A Common Stock and Series B Common
Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be perinitted and any fractional
voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of
Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole
number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Voting for the Election of Directors. As long as at least
37,370,484 shares (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like) of Legacy Preferred Stock originally issued remain outstanding, the
holders of shares of Legacy Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect nine (9) directors of this
corporation. As long as at least 7,871,778 shares (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) of Series A10 Preferred
Stock originally issued remain outstanding, the holders of shares of Series A10 Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation. The holders of outstanding Series A
Common Stock and Series B Common Stock (voting together as a single class and not as
separate series) shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of this corporation. The holders of
Legacy Preferred Stock, Series A10 Preferred Stock, Series A Common Stock and Series B
Common Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series, and on an as-
converted basis) shall be entitled to elect any remaining directors of this corporation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of this Restated Certificate, and
vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may be filled through the nomination
and election by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not

as separate series) and/or the holders of outstanding Series A Common Stock and Series B
Common Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series), as the case may be;
provided, however, that to the extent a vacancy occurs (from the removal or resignation of a
director), such vacancy shall be filled by the holders of the shares of the class(es) or series of
stock entitled to elect such director or directors, and such chosen director shall hold office until
the next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless
sooner displaced; and no such directorship may be filled by shareholders of this corporation
other than by the class(es) or series of shareholders of this corporation that are entitled to elect a
person to fill such directorship, voting exclusively and together as a separate class. The holders
of record of the shares of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock and of any other
class or series of voting stock (including the Preferred Stock), exclusively and voting together as
a single class, shall be entitled to elect the balance of the total number of directors of this
corporation. Any director may be removed during his or her term of office, either with or
without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or
series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such
stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and
any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock
represented at the meeting or pursuant to written consent.

6. Protective Provisions.

(a) Protective Provisions Applicable to the Preferred Stock. So long
as at least 50,679,507 shares (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations,
subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like) of Preferred Stock originally issued remain
outstanding, this corporation shall not, and shall cause any subsidiary of this corporation not to
(by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise), without (in addition to any other vote
required by law or the Restated Certificate) first obtaining the approval by vote or written
consent, as provided by law, of holders constituting the Requisite Investor Threshold, and any
such act or transaction entered into without such consent or vote shall be null and void ab initio,
and of no force or effect:

(i) consummate a Liquidation Event or effect any other merger
or consolidation;

(ii) | amend, alter or repeal any provision of this corporation’s
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws so as to adversely alter or change the powers, preferences,
rights or special privileges of the shares of Preferred Stock;

(iii) | increase or decrease (other than in connection with a
conversion and as contemplated by this Restated Certificate) the total number of authorized
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock;

(iv) (A) create or adopt any equity incentive or employee
compensation plan that has not been adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by this
corporation’s stockholders prior to the Filing Date, (B) create or approve any equity
compensation agreement that is not made pursuant to a plan that has been adopted by the Board
of Directors and approved by this corporation’s stockholders prior to the Filing Date (such plans

and agreements referenced in clauses (A) or (B) collectively, the “Equity Plans”), or (C) increase
or decrease the number of shares reserved in any Equity Plans that are effective as of the Filing
Date (the total number of reserved shares under all Equity Plans that are effective as of the Filing
Date, as increased from time to time in accordance with clause (C), the “Maximum Service
Provider Share Number”); provided, that, the issuance by this corporation of securities to
independent contractors that are not natural persons, as consideration for the provision of
services or otherwise (any such issuance, a “Non-Plan Grant”), on or after the Filing Date, shall
not require any approval pursuant to this Section 6(a) to the extent that the sum of (1) the number
of securities subject to such Non-Plan Grant, (2) the number of securities issued and outstanding
under all Equity Plans as of the date of the issuance of a Non-Plan Grant and (3) the number of

of the General Corporation Law.

5. Conversion. The shares of Series B Common Stock and Series C
Common Stock (collectively, the “Convertible Common Stock”) are convertible as follows:

(a) Right to Convert Series B Common Stock. Each share of
Series B Common Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after
the date of issuance of such share at the office of this corporation or any transfer agent for such
stock, into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Series A Common Stock.

(b) Automatic Conversion of Series B Common Stock. At any
time following the closing of a Qualified Public Offering, upon any transfer, other than a
Permitted Transfer (as defined below), of a share of Series B Common Stock, such share of
Series B Common Stock shall automatically be converted into one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of Series A Common Stock. “Permitted Transfer” means a transfer of
Series B Common Stock by a holder (i) for estate planning purposes, either during such holder’s
lifetime or on death by will or intestacy to such holder’s spouse or other member of a holder’s
immediate family, or to a custodian, trustee (including a trustee of a voting trust), executor or
other fiduciary for the account of the holder’s spouse or members of the holder’s immediate
family, or to a trust for the holder’s own self, or a charitable remainder trust or (ii) to one or more
of such holder’s Affiliates. “Affiliates” means, with respect to any person, any other person who
or which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such
specified person, including, without limitation, any general pariuer, officer, director or manager
of such person and any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing that is controlled by one or
more general pasiners or managing members of, or is under common investment management
with, such person.

(c) Automatic Conversion of Series C Common Stock. Each
share of Series C Common Stock shall be automatically converted into one (1) share of Series A
Common Stock upon the earliest to occur of (i) the closing of a Qualified Public Offering,
(ii) any transfer of such share to a holder of Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, which transfer has been approved by the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion, and (iii) a merger or consolidation of this corporation with or into another entity other
than a merger or consolidation (x) that would result in the voting securities outstanding
immediately prior thereto continuing to represent over fifty percent (50%) of the combined
voting power of the voting securities of this corporation or the surviving entity or its parent
corporation outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation or (y) effected to
implement a recapitalization of this corporation in which no person or entity acquires more than
fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of this corporation’s then outstanding
securities, which person or entity did not possess such voting power prior to such
recapitalization. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the
closing date of the public offering described in clause (i), upon the transfer described in clause
(ii) and immediately prior to a merger or consolidation of the kind described in clause (iii).

(d) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series B
Common Stock shall be entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of Series A Common
Stock pursuant to subsection (C)(5)(a), he, she or it shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any transfer agent for the Common
Stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its principal corporate office, of the
election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Series A Common Stock are to be issued. Thereupon, there shall be
issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as provided in such

written notice, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series A Common Stock
into which the shares of Series B Common Stock so surrendered were convertible on the date of
such written notice. Upon the occurrence of an automatic conversion of Convertible Common
Stock pursuant to subsection (C)(5)(b) or subsection (C)(5)(c), the holders of such Convertible
Common Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of this
corporation or any transfer agent for the Common Stock. Thereupon, there shall be issued and
delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered
certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Series A
Common Stock into which the shares of Convertible Common Stock surrendered were
convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such conversion shall occur automatically without the need for any further action by
the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are
surrendered to this corporation or its transfer agent; provided, however, that this corporation
shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Series A Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Convertible
Common Stock are either delivered to this corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or
the holder notifies this corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to this corporation to indemnify this
corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

(e) Adjustments for Stock Splits or Combinations. If at any
time or from time to time after the date of filing of this Restated Certificate with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (the “Effective Time”), this corporation effects a subdivision of
the outstanding shares of the Series A Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Series
A Common Stock without an equivalent subdivision of the outstanding shares of Convertible
Common Stock, or of either the Series B Common Stock or the Series C Common Stock, then, in
the event of a conversion of shares of the applicable Convertible Common Stock into shares of
Series A Common Stock, such shares of Convertible Common Stock shall convert into a number
of shares of Series A Common Stock that has been proportionately increased. If at any time or
from time to time after the Effective Time, this corporation effects a combination of the
outstanding shares of the Series A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Series A
Common Stock without an equivalent combination of the outstanding shares of Convertible
Common Stock, or of either the Series B Common Stock or the Series C Common Stock, then, in
the event of a conversion of shares of the applicable Convertible Common Stock into shares of
Series A Common Stock, such shares of Convertible Common Stock shall convert into a number
of shares of Series A Common Stock that has been proportionately decreased. If at any time or
from time to time after the Effective Time, this corporation effects a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock into a greater number of shares of Preferred Stock
without an equivalent subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series A Common Stock, then, in
the event of a conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Series A Common Stock, the
applicable Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock shall proportionately
increase. If at any time or from time to time after the Effective Time, this corporation effects a
combination of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock into a smaller number of shares of
Preferred Stock without an equivalent combination of the outstanding shares of Series A
Common Stock, then, in the event of a conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of
Series A Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price for each such series of Preferred Stock
shall proportionately decrease.

(f) Record Holders. The persons entitled to shares of Series A
Common Stock upon conversion of Convertible Common Stock shall be treated for all purposes
as the record holders of such shares of Series A Common Stock as of the date of conversion.

(g) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. This
corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Series A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of
the Convertible Common Stock, such number of its shares of Series A Common Stock as shall
from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Convertible
Common Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Series A
Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of
Convertible Common Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the
holders of Convertible Common Stock, this corporation will take such corporate action as may,
in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Series
A Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including,
without limitation, engaging in commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

(h) Status of Converted Stock. In the event any shares of
Convertible Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to this subsection (C)(5), the shares so
converted shall be cancelled and shall not be issuable by this corporation. The Restated
Certificate shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in this
corporation’s authorized capital stock.

determination of entitlement to indemnification of persons who are non-director or officer
