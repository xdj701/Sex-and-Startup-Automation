preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on Common Stock when, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors. No right shall accrue to holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, holders of Series A-2
Preferred Stock, holders of Series A-3 Preferred Stock, holders of Series B Preferred Stock, holders of
Series C Preferred Stock, holders of Series D Preferred Stock or holders of Series E Preferred Stock by
reason of the fact that dividends on such shares are not declared or paid in any prior year. The holders of
the Preferred Stock also shall be entitled to participate pro rata in any dividends or other distributions paid
on the Common Stock on an as-if-converted basis.

In the event that the Corporation shall have declared but unpaid dividends outstanding
immediately prior to, and in the event of, a conversion of Preferred Stock (as provided in Article 5
Section 3 hereof), the Corporation shall, at the option of the Corporation, pay in cash to each holder of

converted into Common Stock in accordance with, and pursuant to the teiiis specified in, Article 5
Section 3 hereof.

Section 2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event (as defined below) of the Corporation, either
voluntary or involuntary, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of the
Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, the holders
of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive for each outstanding share of Preferred Stock then held by
them an amount equal to (i) in the case of Series E Preferred Stock, $1.2394 plus declared but unpaid
dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock
combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like), (ii) in the case of Series D Preferred Stock,
$0.3594 plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like), (iii)in the case of
Series C Preferred Stock, $0.3594 plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as
appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the

case of Series A-3 Preferred Stock, $0.02855 plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each
case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits

legally available for distribution to stockholders by reason of their ownership of stock of the Corporation
shall be insufficient to pe:mit the payment to such holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, holders of the
Series D Preferred Stock, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock,
holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock and holders of the
Series A-3 Preferred Stock of the full aforementioned preferential amounts, then the entire assets and
funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders by reason of their ownership of
stock of the Corporation shall be distributed on a pari passu basis among the holders of the Preferred
Stock in proportion to the aggregate preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.

(b) After payment has been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the full amounts to
which they shall be entitled as provided in subsection (a) above, if assets available for distribution remain
in the Corporation, all remaining assets of the Corporation shall be distributed among all holders of the
Preferred Stock and all holders of Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding and the number of shares of Common Stock which would be held by each holder of
Preferred Stock if all shares of the Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock at the then
effective Conversion Price (as set forth in Article 5 Section 3(a) below) until: (i) with respect to the
Series E Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate of
$3.7182 per share of Series E Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each
case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits
and the like), including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above; (ii) with respect to the Series D,
the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate of $1.0782 per share of
Series D Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as appropriately
adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like),
including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above; (iii) with respect to the Series C Preferred
Stock, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate of $1.0782 per share

appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the
like), including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above; (iv) with respect to the Series B Preferred
Stock, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate of $0.66039 per share
of Series B Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as
appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the
like), including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above; (v) with respect to the Series A-1
Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate of $0.3426
per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as
appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the
like), including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above; (vi) with respect to the Series A-2
Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate of $0.2913
per share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in each case, as
appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the
like), including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above; and (vii) with respect to the Series A-3
Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A-3 Preferred Stock shall have received an aggregate of
$0.08565 per share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock plus declared but unpaid dividends on such share (in
each case, as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock
splits and the like), including amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) above. Thereafter, all remaining
assets and surplus funds shall be distributed to the holders of Common Stock pro rata according to the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock then held by each of them. Notwithstanding the above,
for purposes of deteiinining the amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive with
respect to a Liquidation Event, each such holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have

converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted) such holder’s shares into shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Event if, as a result of an actual conversion, such
holder would receive, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to
such holder if such holder did not convert such Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any
such holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to
this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would otherwise be
made to holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been deemed to have converted)
into shares of Common Stock.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed to by the holders of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the
then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis), a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation under this Article 5 Section 2 shall be deemed to
be occasioned by, and to include, in addition to a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, (i)a merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization or reorganization of the
Corporation with or into any other corporation, corporations or other entity (excluding any merger
effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the corporation); (ii) any other
transaction or series of related transactions, in which the stockholders of the corporation immediately
prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation own, by virtue of their shares held prior to such
transaction, less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving entity; or (iii) a sale,
conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, including
pursuant to the grant of an exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s products, assets
or intellectual property, in one transaction or a series of transactions (any such transaction, a “Liquidation
Event”); provided, that this provision shall not apply if the holders of voting securities of the Corporation
immediately prior to such Liquidation Event beneficially own, directly or indirectly, a majority of the
combined voting power of the surviving entity resulting from such Liquidation Event in approximately
the same relative percentages before such Liquidation Event as after.

(d) Notwithstanding this Article 5 Section 2, each holder of Preferred Stock shall have the
right to elect the benefits of the provisions of Article 5 Section 3(a) below or other applicable conversion
provisions in lieu of receiving payment on any Liquidation Event of the Corporation, either voluntary or
involuntary, pursuant to this Article 5 Section 2.

(e) In any of such events, if the consideration received by the Corporation or its stockholders
is other than cash or securities, its value will be deemed its fair market value, as deteimined in good faith
by the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued as follows:

(i) Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free
marketability covered by (ii) below:

(1) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be deemed to be the
average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the twenty (20) day period ending
three (3) days prior to the closing of the transaction in subsection 2(c) above;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the
average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the twenty (20) day period ending
three (3) days prior to the closing of the transaction in subsection 2(c) above; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market
value thereof, as deteiiiiined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(ii) The method of valuation of securities subject to invesiment letter or other
restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status
as an affiliate or foiiner affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value
determined as above in subsection (i)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(iii) | The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be distributed in
connection with a Liquidation Event shall, with the appropriate approval of the definitive agreements
governing such Liquidation Event by the stockholders under the General Corporation Law and Section 6
of this Article V, be superseded by the deteiinination of such value set forth in the definitive agreements
governing such Liquidation Event.

(f) In the event the requirements of this Section 2 are not complied with, the Corporation
shall forthwith either cause the closing of the Liquidation Event to be postponed until the requirements of
this Section 2 have been complied with, or cancel such Liquidation Event, in which event the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of the holders of Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately prior to the date of the first
notice referred to in Section 3(g).

Section 3. Conversion. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the
holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any
transfer agent for such Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock as is dete::mined by dividing the applicable original issue price of such shares of Preferred
Stock (the “Original Issue Price”) by the applicable conversion price for such series of Preferred Stock
that is in effect at the time of conversion (the “Conversion Price” and, such resulting ratio, the
“Conversion Rate”). The Original Issue Price per share of Series E Preferred Stock is $1.2394 (as
appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the
like). The Original Issue Price per share of Series D Preferred Stock is $0.3594 (as appropriately adjusted
for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original
Issue Price per share of SeriesC Preferred Stock is $0.3594 (as appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original Issue Price
per share of Series B Preferred Stock is $0.22013 (as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations,
stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original Issue Price per share of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock is $0.1142 (as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock
combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original Issue Price per share of Series A-2
Preferred Stock is $0.0971 (as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock
dividends, stock splits and the like). The Original Issue Price per share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock is
$0.02855 (as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock
splits and the like). The initial Conversion Price per share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be $1.2401,
the initial Conversion Price per share of Series D Preferred Stock shall be $0.3594, the initial Conversion
Price per share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be $0.3594, the initial Conversion Price per share of
Series B Preferred Stock shall be $0.22013, the initial Conversion Price per share of Series A-] Preferred
Stock shall be $0.1142, the initial Conversion Price per share of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be
$0.0971, and the initial Conversion Price per share of the Series A-3 Preferred Stock shall be $0.02855, in
each case subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted
into shares of Common Stock at the then effective applicable Conversion Rate for each series of Preferred

Stock immediately upon the earlier of: (i) the effectiveness of a fii commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act’), covering the offer and sale of Common Stock with an offering price per share of not
less than $3.7182 (as appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock
dividends, stock splits and the like) and aggregate proceeds to the Corporation of not less than
$25,000,000 (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) (a “Qualified IPO”), or (ii) the date
specified pursuant to an election to convert all shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock by holders
of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as
a single class on an as-converted basis, at a duly held meeting or by written consent or other agreement.

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional share to which a holder would otherwise be
entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. Before any holder of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender
the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer
agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that the
holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall also state whether the holder elects, subject to
Article 5 Section 1 hereof, to receive declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock proposed to be
converted in cash, or to convert such dividends into shares of Common Stock at their fair market value as
determined by the Board of Directors. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and
deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the
holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into a fractional share of
Common Stock, and, subject to Article 5 Section | hereof, any declared but unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock which the holder elected to receive in cash. Such conversion shall be deemed
to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares
of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic
conversion pursuant to Article 5 Section 3(b) above, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such Preferred Stock and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; and
provided, further, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or such
holder of Preferred Stock notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost
certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled and a
check payable to such holder of Preferred Stock in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result
of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock and any declared but unpaid dividends on the
converted Preferred Stock which the holder elected to receive in cash.

If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities pursuant to the
Securities Act in accordance with Article 5 Section 3(b)(i) above, the conversion may, at the option of
any holder tendering shares of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the
underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to

receive the Common Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted
such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

If the conversion is in connection with a Liquidation Event of the Corporation described in
Article 5 Section 2 above, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of Preferred
Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the consummation of the Liquidation Event, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed
to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the consummation of the Liquidation
Event.

upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of
conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, each
applicable Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be
recomputed as if:

(i) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for
Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were shares of Common Stock, if
any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually
received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or
exchange; and

(ii) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only
the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of
issue of such Options and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of
Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the
Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to
have been received by the Corporation upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which
such Options were actually exercised; and

(D) __ no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall have
the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock to an amount which
exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price for that series on the original adjusi:ment date, or (ii) the
Conversion Price for that series that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(2) Stock Dividends. Except as provided in Article 5 Section 3(d)i)(4)
above, in the event the Corporation, at any time or from time to time after the date of filing hereof, shall
declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, then Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued immediately after the close of business on the record
date for the deteriiination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive such dividend.

(iv) | Adiusiment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common
Stock. In the event the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Article 5 Section 3(d)(iii)) without

consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price with respect to any series of
Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest $0.00001) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such issue plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at
such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock
so issued; and provided, further, that, for the purposes of this Article 5 Section 3(d){iv), all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock and all outstanding
Convertible Securities, and upon exercise of all outstanding Options bearing an exercise price which is
lower than the price at which the Additional Shares of Common Stock were issued (or deemed to be
issued), shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Article 5 Section 3(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall
be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(A) _ insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or
accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at
the fair value thereof at the time of such issuance, as dete:mined by the Board of Directors in the good
faith exercise of its reasonable business judgiuent; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued
together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers
both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (A) and (B)
above, as deteiiiined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued
pursuant to Article 5 Section 3(d)(iii)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
deteiiiined by dividing

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjusiment of such consideration) payable to
the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth
in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities.

(3) Stock Dividends. Any Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to
have been issued relating to stock dividends shall be deemed to have been issued for no consideration.

(vi) | Adiusiments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or
Subdivisions of Common Stock. In the event that (a) the Corporation at any time or from time to time on
or after the Filing Date shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock
payable in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock for no consideration, (b) the
Corporation at any time or from time to time on or after the Filing Date shall effect a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split,
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire
Common Stock), or (c) the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by
reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price
for any series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such event shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. In the event that
the Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable
in any right to acquire Common Stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have
made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to the maximum number of
shares issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock.

(vii) Adiusiments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of
shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or
otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Article 5 Section 3(d\(vi)
above or a merger or other reorganization referred to in Article 5 Section 2 above), the Conversion Prices
then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be
proportionately adjusted so that the various series of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into a number of
shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that
would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately
before that change.

(viii) | Reorganizations. Mergers. Consolidations or Sales of Assets. If at any time or
from time to time on or after the Filing Date, there is a Capital Reorganization (other than a Liquidation
Event of the Corporation as defined in Article 5 Section2 or as a recapitalization, subdivision,
combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Article 5
Section 3), provision shall be made as a part of such Capital Reorganization to the effect that the holders
of the various series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation to which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled
on such Capital Reorganization, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the ters
thereof. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this
Article 5 Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock after the Capital
Reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Article 5 Section 3 (including adjustment of the
Conversion Prices then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred
Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(1) For purposes of this Article5 Section 3(d)(viii), a “Capital
Reorganization” shall mean a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another person
(other than a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing entity and which does
not result in any change in the Common Stock) or a capital reorganization of the Common Stock (other
than as a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares
provided for elsewhere in this Article 5 Section 3).

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any Capital
Reorganization that constitutes a Liquidation Event of the Corporation (as defined in Article 5 Section 2
above), the holders of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect, by providing written
notice of such election to the Corporation within twenty (20) days of receiving notice of such Capital
Reorganization, to treat such transaction as a Capital Reorganization and not as a Liquidation Event of the
Corporation, in which event the provisions of this Article 5 Section 3(d)(viii) shall apply. Such election
shall apply to all outstanding Preferred Stock. In the absence of such an election, a Capital
Reorganization that constitutes a Liquidation Event of the Corporation shall be treated as a Liquidation
Event of the Corporation and not as a Capital Reorganization.

(ix) _ Adiustments for Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation at any time or
from time to time makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive any distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock
and other than as otherwise adjusted in this Article 5 Section 3, then and in each such event provision
shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive upon such distribution the amount of
securities of the Corporation which they would have received had their Preferred Stock converted into
Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such
event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by than as aforesaid
during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Article 5
Section 3 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.

(e) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, without the appropriate vote of the
stockholders under the Delaware General Corporation Law or Section 6 of this Article V, by amendment
of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the te:ms to be observed or perfouned hereunder by the
Corporation.

(f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjusiment or readjustment
of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Article 5 Section 3, the Corporation shall promptly compute such
adjustment or readjusiiient in accordance with the te::us hereof. The Corporation shall, upon the written
request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
certificate setting forth (i) the particulars of any adjustment to the Conversion Price since issuance of the
Preferred Stock, (ii) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock currently in effect and (iii) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(g) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at any time:

(i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in cash,
property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of
earnings or earned surplus;

(ii) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock shares
outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock shares; or

(iii) to undergo a Liquidation Event;

then, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall send to the holders of the Preferred Stock:

(1) at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice of the date on which a record
shall be taken for such dividend or distribution (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common
Stock shall be entitled thereto) in respect of the matters referred to in (i) above or for detexiuining rights to
vote in respect of the matters referred to in (ii) and (iii) above; and

(2) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii), above, at least ten (10) days’
prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and specifying the date on which the
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other
property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).

(3) Each such written notice shall be delivered personally, given by
facsimile or given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of Preferred Stock shares
at the address for each such holder as shown on the books of the Corporation.

(h) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, in
addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holders of such Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase
its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for
such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder
approval of any necessary amendment hereunder.

Section 4. Voting Rights and Directors.

(a) Vote Other than for Directors. Except as otherwise required by law and as provided in
the next sentence and in subsection (b) below with respect to the election of directors and in Article 5
Section 6 below with respect to the Protective Provisions, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders
of Common Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting and will vote together and not
as separate classes upon any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote, as follows: (i) each holder of
Preferred Stock shall have one vote for each full share of Common Stock into which such holder’s shares
of Preferred Stock would be convertible on the record date for the vote, and (ii) the holders of Common
Stock shall have one vote per share of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased by the affimative vote of the holders of a majority of
Preferred Stock and Common Stock, voting together as one class and each holder of Preferred Stock
having that number of votes per share as is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which
each such share of Preferred Stock held by such holder could be converted pursuant to Article 5 Section 3
on the date for deteiinination of stockholders entitled to vote on such increase or decrease. Fractional
votes shall not, however, be periuitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis
(after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted)
shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

(b) Number and Election of Directors.
(i) The authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be seven (7).
14

(ii) For so long as at least 2,700,000 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, not as a
separate series and on an as-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member to the Board of
Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of
directors.

(iii) For so long as at least 3,500,000 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled
to elect one (1) member of the Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the
Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors.

(iv) For so long as at least 3,500,000 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be
entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of
the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors.

(v) For so long as at least 3,500,000 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be
entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of
the Corporation’s stockholders for the election of directors.

(vi) The remaining three (3) members of the Board of Directors shall be elected by
the holders of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock voting together as a single class on an as-
converted basis.

(c) Vacancies; Removal. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors occurring because of the
death, resignation or removal of a director elected in accordance with Article 5 Section 4(b) above shall
be filled by the vote or written consent of such percentage of the voting group which elected such director
as specified in Article 5 Section 4(b) above, or, in the absence of such action by such holders, by
unanimous action of the remaining director or directors elected by the holders of such class. A director
may be removed from the Board of Directors with or without cause by the vote or consent of the voting
group entitled to elect such director in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.

Section 5. Redemption. The holders of Preferred Stock shall have redemption rights as
follows:

(a) Redemption Date and Price. At any time after October 13, 2018, but on a date (the
“Redemption Date”) no later than 30 days after receipt by the Corporation of a written request (a
“Redemption Election”) from the holders of not less than sixty-seven percent (67%) of the then
outstanding Preferred Stock that all of the shares of Preferred Stock be redeemed, the Corporation shall,
to the extent it may lawfully do so, redeem all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock specified in the
Redemption Election in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5 by paying in cash
therefor a sum per share with respect to each share of Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i) the
applicable Original Issue Price of such share of Preferred Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reclassifications or the like and pursuant to Article 5, Section 3) plus all declared but unpaid
dividends on such share or (ii) the fair market value of such share of Preferred Stock as deteiinined by an

appraisal perfo.ued by an independent third party appraiser approved by the holders of at least sixty-
seven percent (67%) of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the Corporation, without
deduction from such value based upon such share being a minority interest in the Corporation nor based
upon the lack of marketability thereof (the “Redemption Price”).

(b) Procedure. No \ater than 15 days following its receipt of the Redemption Election, the
Corporation shall mail a written notice, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of
business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of Preferred Stock at the
address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the
redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the
Redemption Date, the applicable Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and
calling upon such holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, such
holder’s certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the “Redemption Notice”).
Except as provided in Section 5(c) below, on or after the Redemption Date, each holder of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such
shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the
Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such
certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled.

(c) Effect of Redemption; Insufficient Funds. From and after the Redemption Date, unless
there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice (except the right to receive the
Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with
respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Corporation
or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the funds of the Corporation legally
available for redemption of shares of Preferred Stock on the Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem
the total number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders
of such shares to be redeemed based upon the total Redemption Price applicable to each such holder’s
shares of Preferred Stock. The shares of Preferred Stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and
entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein, including, but not limited to, the conversion
rights set forth herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally
available for the redemption of shares of Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem
the balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obliged to redeem on the Redemption Date
but which it has not redeemed.

Section 6. Protective Provisions. In addition to any other rights provided by law, the
Corporation shall not (whether by merger, consolidation, amendment or otherwise), without first
