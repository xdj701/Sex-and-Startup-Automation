The following is a statement of the designations and the powers, privileges and
rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof in respect of each class of capital
stock of the Corporation.

A. COMMON STOCK

1. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders
of the Preferred Stock set forth herein.

2. Voting. Except as required by applicable law, the holders of Common
Stock shall be entitled to vote on each matter on which the stockholders of the Corporation shall
be entitled generally to vote at all meetings of the stockholders (and written actions in lieu of
meetings), and each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of
Common Stock held by such holder. Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 3.3 of Part B
of Article FOURTH of this Certificate of Incorporation, the number of authorized shares of
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
Tepresenting a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General
Corporation Law.

B. PREFERRED STOCK

All of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock are hereby
designated “Series Seed Preferred Stock” with the following rights, preferences, powers,
privileges, restrictions, qualifications and limitations. Unless otherwise indicated, references to
“Sections” or “Subsections” in this PartB of this Article FOURTH refer to sections and
subsections of Part B of this Article FOURTH.

1. Dividends. The holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any
declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities
and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock of the Corporation) on the Common Stock of the
Corporation, at the applicable Dividend Rate (as defined below), payable when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. The holders of the
outstanding Series Seed Preferred Stock may waive any dividend preference that such holders
shall be entitled to receive under this Section 1 upon the affirmative vote or written consent of
the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock then outstanding.
After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends or distributions shall be distributed
among all holders of Common Stock and Series Seed Preferred Stock in proportion to the
number of shares of Common Stock that would be held by each such holder if all shares of Series
Seed Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock at the then effective conversion rate.
For purposes of this Section 1, “Dividend Rate” shall mean an amount equal to 8% of the Series
Seed Original Issue Price (as defined herein). The “Series Seed Original Issue Price” shall
mean $1.00 per share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock
split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series Seed Preferred
Stock.

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up; Certain Mergers, Consolidations and
Asset Sales.

2.1 Preferential Payments to Holders of Series Seed Preferred Stock. In the
event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
or Deemed Liquidation Event, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other
liabilities of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the remaining assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common
Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the greater of (a) the
Series Seed Original Issue Price, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (b) such
amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock been
converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 immediately prior to such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event (the amount payable pursuant to this
sentence being hereinafter referred to as the “Series Seed Liquidation Amount”). If, upon any
such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or Deemed Liquidation Event, the
remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be
insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock the full amount to which
they shall be entitled under this Subsection 2.1, the holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred
Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion
to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by
them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in
full.

2.2 _ Distribution of Remaining Assets. In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or Deemed Liquidation
Event, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the

Corporation and the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of
shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of the shares of Common
Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder.

2.3 Deemed Liquidation Events.

2.3.1 Definition. Each of the following events shall be considered a
“Deemed Liquidation Event” unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Series Seed Preferred Stock elect otherwise by written notice sent to the Corporation at least
two business days prior to the effective date of any such event:

(a) a merger or consolidation in which:
(i) the Corporation is a constituent party; or

(ii) a subsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party
and the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock
pursuant to such merger or consolidation,

except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the
shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such merger or
Consolidation continue to represent, or are converted into or exchanged for shares of capital stock
that represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, a majority, by voting power,
of the capital stock of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation or (2) if the surviving or resulting
corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following such
merger or consolidation, the parent corporation of such surviving or resulting corporation
(provided that, for the purpose of this Subsection 2.3.1, all shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of Convertible Securities (as defined below) outstanding immediately prior to
such merger or consolidation shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation and, if applicable, converted or exchanged in such merger or
consolidation on the same terms as the actual outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted
or exchanged); or

(b) _ the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license to a single entity
(or a single group of affiliated entities) or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation of all or
substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the sale or
disposition (whether by merger or otherwise) of one or more subsidiaries of the Corporation if
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by
such subsidiary or subsidiaries, except where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other
disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation.

2.3.2 Effecting a Deemed Liquidation Event.

(a) The Corporation shall not have the power to effect a
Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in Subsection 2.3.1(a)(i) unless the agreement or plan of

merger or consolidation for such transaction (the “Merger Agreement”) provides that the
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the
holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Subsections 2.1 and 2.2.

(b) _—_‘In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in
Subsection 2.3.1(a)(ii) or 2.3.1(b), if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the
Corporation under the General Corporation Law within 90 days after such Deemed Liquidation
Event, then (i) the Corporation shall send a written notice to each holder of Series Seed Preferred
Stock no later than the 90" day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising such holders of
their right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the tens of the
following clause (ii) to require the redemption of such shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, and
(ii) if the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred
Stock so request in a written instrument delivered to the Corporation not later than 120 days after
such Deemed Liquidation Event, the Corporation shall use the consideration received by the
Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net of any retained liabilities associated with
the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation), together with any other assets of the Corporation available for distribution to
its stockholders (the “Available Proceeds”), to the extent legally available therefor, on the 150"
day after such Deemed Liquidation Event, to redeem all outstanding shares of Series Seed
Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series Seed Liquidation Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence,
if the Available Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Series Seed
Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of Series
Seed Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such Available Proceeds, based on the respective
amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the
Available Procccds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining
shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally
available therefor. Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this
Subsection 2.3.2(b), the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for
such Deemed Liquidation Event, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection with such
Deemed Liquidation Event or in the ordinary course of business.

2.4 Amount Deemed Paid or Distributed. In any Deemed Liquidation Event,
if Available Proceeds are other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any
securities shall be valued as follows:

2.4.1 Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar
restrictions on free marketability covered by Subsection 2.4.2 below:

(a) If traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over
the 30 trading-day period ending three) trading days prior to the closing of the Deemed
Liquidation Event;

(b) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be
deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30

trading-day period ending three trading days prior to the closing of the Deemed Liquidation
Event; and

(©) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the
fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

2.4.2 The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letters
or other similar restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue
of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to take into account an
appropriate discount (as dete:mined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation)
from the market value as deteiinined pursuant to clause (a) above so as to reflect the approximate
fair market value thereof.

2.4.3. The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be
distributed in connection with a Deemed Liquidation Event shall be superseded by any
determination of such value set forth in the definitive agreements governing such Deemed
Liquidation Event.

2.4.4 Allocation of Escrow. Unless otherwise approved in a writing
executed by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock that is
delivered to the Corporation, in the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event, if any portion of the
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation is placed into escrow, the definitive
agreement for such transaction (or, with respect to a Deemed Liquidation Event in connection
with which the Corporation is dissolved, the definitive documents for such dissolution) shall
provide that (a) the portion of such consideration that is not placed in escrow and not subject to
any contingencies (the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 as if the Initial Consideration
were the only consideration payable in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event and (b)
any additional consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon
release from escrow or satisfaction of contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 after taking into account
the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction.

3. Voting.

3.1. General. The holder of each share of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall
have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock
could then be converted and, with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights
and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be
entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. The holders of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to vote together with holders of Common Stock with respect to any question upon
which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be
permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating
all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be
rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).

3.2 Voting for the Election of Directors. At any time when shares of Series
Seed Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock,
exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect one director of the Corporation at
any election of directors (the “Series Seed Designee”). If the holders of shares of Series Seed
Preferred Stock fail to elect the Series Seed Designee, voting exclusively and as a separate class,
pursuant to the first sentence of this Subsection 3.2, then any directorship not so filled shall
remain vacant until such time as the holders of the Series Seed Preferred Stock elect a person to
fill such directorship by vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting; and no such directorship
may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than by the stockholders of the
Corporation that are entitled to elect a person to fill such directorship, voting exclusively and as a
separate class. The holders of record of the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock,
exclusively and voting together as a single class on an as-if converted to Common Stock basis,
shall be entitled to elect the balance of the total number of directors of the Corporation and each
such remaining nominee for director shall be elected by the majority of the votes cast in favor of
such nominee’s election by the holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. At any meeting
held for the purpose of electing a director, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series entitled to elect such director shall
constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing such director. Except as otherwise provided in
this Subsection 3.2, a vacancy in any directorship filled by the holders of any class or series shall
be filled only by vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting of the holders of such class or series
or by any remaining director or directors elected by the holders of such class or series pursuant to
this Subsection 3.2.

3.3. Protective Provisions. At any time when any shares of Series Seed
Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, either directly or indirectly by
amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise, do any of the following without (in addition to
any other vote required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation) the written consent or
affiisuative vote of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series Seed
Preferred Stock, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may

4. Optional Conversion. The holders of the Series Seed Preferred Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

4.1 Right to Convert.

4.1.1 Conversion Ratio. Each share of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall
be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without
the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is deteiiuined by dividing the Series Seed Original
Issue Price by the Series Seed Conversion Price (as defined below) for such series of Preferred
Stock in effect at the time of conversion. The “Series Seed Conversion Price” shall initially be
equal to the Series Seed Original Issue Price. The initial Series Seed Conversion Price, and the
rate at which shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common
Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

4.1.2 Termination of Conversion Rights. Subject to Section 4.3.1 in the
case of a Contingency Event (as defined therein), in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall
teuuinate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the first date fixed for the
payment of any funds and assets distributable on such event to the holders of Series Seed
Preferred Stock.

42 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series Seed Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable
upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series
Seed Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

4.3 Mechanics of Conversion.

4.3.1 Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Series Seed
Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of
Series Seed Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that any such certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to

the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office
of the transfer agent for the Series Seed Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that
such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Series Seed Preferred Stock
represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such
conversion is contingent (a “Contingency Event”). Such notice shall state such holder’s name
or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares
of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for
conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer,
in fou reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such
holder’s attomey duly authorized in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the
transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such
certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or, if later, the date on which
all Contingency Events have occurred) shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time”),
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such
certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Time (i) issue and deliver to such holder of Series Seed
Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions
hereof, and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock
represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, (ii) pay in
cash such amount as provided in Subsection 4.2 in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on
the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock converted.

4.3.2 Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times when the
Series Seed Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series Seed
Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time
to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Series Seed Prefisred Stock; and
if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series Seed Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation. Before
taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Series Seed Conversion Price
below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a series of
Series Seed Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series Seed Conversion
Price.

4.3.3. Effect of Conversion. All shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock
which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed

to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate
at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise
issuable upon such conversion as provided in Subsection 4.2 and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock so converted
shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the
Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action)
as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock
accordingly.

4.3.4 No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment
to the Series Sccd Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the
shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock
delivered upon conversion.

4.3.5 Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issuance and other
similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The
Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other
than that in which the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no
such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such
issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

4.4 Adjustments to Series Seed Conversion Price for Diluting Issuances.

4.4.1 Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article FOURTH, the
following definitions shall apply:

(a) “Options” shall mean rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities.

(b) “Series Seed Original Issue Date” shall mean the first

44.3 Deemed Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(a) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Series Seed Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding
Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities) or shall fix a
record date for the dete:mination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such
Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set
forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of
the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date.

(b) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjusi:nent to the Series Seed Conversion Price pursuant to the
teuns of Subsection 4.4.4, are revised as a result of an amendment to such te:us or any other
adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding

automatic adjusisments to such teiiiis pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such
Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase and/or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of
any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon
such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Series Seed Conversion Price computed upon
the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date
with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to the Series Seed Conversion Price as would have
obtained had such revised teisns been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option
or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this
clause (b) shall have the effect of increasing the Series Seed Conversion Price to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series Seed Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
the original adjustment made as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security,
or (ii) the amount of the Series Seed Conversion Price that would have resulted from any
issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock (other than deemed issuances of Additional
Shares of Common Stock as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security)
between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(c) ‘If the teiins of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities), the
issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series Seed Conversion Price pursuant to
the teitas of Subsection 4.4.4 (either because the consideration per share (deteiiined pursuant to
Subsection 4.4.5) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or
greater than the Series Seed Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or
Convertible Security was issued before the Series Seed Original Issue Date), are revised after the
Series Seed Original Issue Date as a result of an amendment to such teims or any other
adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding
automatic adjusiments to such teriiis pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such
Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) an increase in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security or (2) a decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such
exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended
or adjusted, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto (deteumined in the
manner provided in Subsection 4.4.3(a)) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such
change becoming effective.

(d) Upon the expiration or teimination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) which resulted
(either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its teins) in an adjustment to the Series
Seed Conversion Price pursuant to the teuus of Subsection 4.4.4, the Series Seed Conversion
Price shall be readjusted to such Series Seed Conversion Price as would have obtained had such
Option or Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

(e) If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is
calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to

adjusiment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the Series Seed Conversion Price
provided for in this Subsection 4.4.3 shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment
based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for
subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses
(b) and (c) of this Subsection 4.4.3). If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange,
cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended,
any adjustment to the Series Seed Conversion Price that would result under the tens of this
Subsection 4.4.3 at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time
such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to
subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the Series
Seed Conversion Price that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation
can first be made.

4.4.4 Adjustment of Series Seed Conversion Price Upon Issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the
Series Seed Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3), without
consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series Seed Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue, then the Series Seed Conversion Price shall be reduced,
concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
deteiniined in accordance with the following fouula:

CP, =CP,* (A+B) =(A+C).
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) “CP,” shall mean the Series Seed Conversion Price in
effect immediately after such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock

(b) “CP,” shall mean the Series Seed Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

(c) “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock (treating for
this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or upon exchange of Convertible
Securities (including, without limitation, the Series Seed Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming
exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);

(d) “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a
price per share equal to CP; (detesiiined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation in respect of such issue by CP;); and

(e) | “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of

Common Stock issued in such transaction.

4.4.5 Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4.4, the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(a) | Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

@

(ii)

(iii)

insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the
Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest;

insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and

in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (i) and (ii) above, as deteiinined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(b) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4.4.3 relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be

dete:mined by dividing:
(i)

the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon
the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the
case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convesiible Securities
and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by

(ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities.

44.6 Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Series Seed
Conversion Price pursuant to the te1us of Subsection 4.4.4, and such issuance dates occur within
a period of no more than 90 days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance, then,
upon the final such issuance, the Series Seed Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect
to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving
effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within such

period).

4.5 Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Series Seed Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock, the Series Seed Conversion Price in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the Series Seed Original Issue Date combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Series Seed Conversion Price in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of business on the date
the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

4.6 Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series Seed Original Issue Date shall make
or issue, or fix a record date for the deteimination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event the Series Seed Conversion Price in effect
immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying the Series Seed Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding

immediately prior to the time of such issuance or
the close of business on such record date, and

(ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number
of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or
the close of business on such record date plus the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series Seed
Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and thereafter the Series Seed Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as
of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (b) no such adjustment shall
be made if the holders of Series Seed Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other
distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock had
been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

4.7 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series Seed Original Issue Date shall make
or issue, or fix a record date for the detei:nination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a
distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in
other property and the provisions of Section 1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then
and in each such event the holders of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously
with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such
securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property
as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock had been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

4.8 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2.3, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Series Seed Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
(other than a transaction covered by Subsections 4.4, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Series
Seed Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it
was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property
which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon
conversion of one share of Series Seed Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive
pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as detesinined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the
provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of
such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this

Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series
Seed Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation
to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series Seed
Preferred Stock.

4.9 Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series Seed Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at
its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 10 days
thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the teuus hereof and
furnish to each holder of Series Seed Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which
Series Seed Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series Seed Preferred Stock (but
in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a
Certificate setting forth (i) the Series Seed Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then
would be received upon the conversion of the Series Seed Preferred Stock.

4.10 Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the
Series Seed Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any
dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of
capital stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other security;

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the
Series Seed Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such
dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or
right, or (ji) the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if
any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other capital
stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series Seed Preferred Stock)
shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share
and character of such exchange applicable to the Series Seed Preferred Stock and the Common
Stock. Such notice shall be sent at least 10 days prior to the record date or effective date for the
event specified in such notice.

5. Mandatory Conversion.

5.1 Trigger Events. Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of
Common Stock to the public at a price per share equal to at least 400% of the Series Seed
Original Issue Price, in a fiiii-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least
$30,000,000 in gross proceeds to the Corporation (before deduction for underwriting
commissions and expenses) (a “Qualified Public Offering”), or (b) the date and time, or the
occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock (the time of such closing or the
date and time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent is
referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Time”), (i) all outstanding shares of Series
Seed Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then
effective conversion rate, and (ii) such shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock may not be reissued
by the Corporation.

5.2. Procedural Requirements. All holders of record of shares of Series Seed
Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place
designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock pursuant
to this Section 5. Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory
Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Series Seed Preferred
Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder
alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and
agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any
claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Series Seed Preferred Stock converted
pursuant to Section 5.1, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a
holder of Common Stock), will te:minate at the Mandatory Conversion Time (notwithstanding
the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or prior to such time),
except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates (or
lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive the items provided for in the next
sentence of this Subsection 5.2. If a conversion pursuant to this Section 5.1 is contingent upon
the closing of an underwritten public offering, such conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected immediately prior to the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant
to such offering. If the conversion is in connection with Subsection 5.1(b) above, such
conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the conversion date described in the
stockholder consent approving such conversion, and the persons entitled to receive shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date. As soon as practicable after the
Mandatory Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) for Series Seed Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver
to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full

shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof,
together with cash as provided in Subsection 4.2 in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid
dividends on the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock converted. Such converted Series Seed
Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series,
and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series
Seed Preferred Stock accordingly.

6. Waiver. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other tezsus of the Series Seed
Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived on behalf of all holders of Series Seed Preferred
Stock by the affisinative written consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of the then-
outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock.

7. Notices. Any notice required or peimitted by the provisions of this Article
FOURTH to be given to a holder of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall be mailed,
postage prepaid, to the post office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given
by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law,
and shall be deemed sent upon such mailing or electronic transmission.
