ARTICLE IV: AUTHORIZED SHARES.

The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is (a) 27,914,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share
(“Common Stock’), and (b) 15,503,588 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share
(“Preferred Stock”). As of the effective date of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this
“Restated Certificate”), 3,137,252 shares of the authorized Preferred Stock of the Corporation
are hereby designated “Series Seed Preferred Stock,’ 3,732,665 shares of the authorized
Preferred Stock of the Corporation are hereby designated “Series A Preferred Stock” , 3,557,532
shares of the authorized Preferred Stock of the Corporation are hereby designated “Series B
Preferred Stock”, and 5,076,139 shares of the authorized Preferred Stock of the Corporation are
hereby designated “Series C Preferred Stock’.

The following is a statement of the designations and the rights, powers and privileges,
and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, in respect of each class of capital stock
of the Corporation.

A. COMMON STOCK

1. General. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the
Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and privileges of the holders of
the Preferred Stock set forth herein.

2. Voting. The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share

of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and written actions in lieu of meetings);
provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as

such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that
relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of
such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more
other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or pursuant to the
General Corporation Law. Unless required by law, there shall be no cumulative voting. The
number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares thereof then outstanding) by (in addition to any vote of the holders of one or
more series of Preferred Stock that may be required by the terms of this Restated Certificate) the
affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing a
majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation
Law and without a separate class vote of the holders of the Common Stock.

B. PREFERRED STOCK

The following rights, powers and privileges, and restrictions, qualifications and
limitations, shall apply to the Preferred Stock. Unless otherwise indicated, references to
“Sections” in this Part B of this Article IV refer to sections of this Part B.

1. Dividends.

1.1 Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock Dividend Preference. The Corporation
shall not pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any other class or series of capital stock of
the Corporation (other than dividends on shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common
Stock) in any calendar year unless (in addition to the obtaining of any consents required
elsewhere in this Restated Certificate) the holders of the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
first receive, or simultaneously receive, out of funds legally available therefor, a dividend on
each outstanding share of Preferred Stock in an amount equal to 8% of the Original Issue Price
(as defined below) per share of such Preferred Stock. The foregoing dividends shall not be
cumulative and shall be paid when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation (the “Board”). For purposes of this Restated Certificate, “Original Issue Price”
shall mean $0.956250072 per share for each share of the Series Seed Preferred Stock (as adjusted
for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like
with respect to such series of Preferred Stock), $5.3581 per share for each share of the Series A
Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions,
recapitalizations or the like with respect to such series of Preferred Stock), $7.1468 per share for
each share of the Series B Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to such series of Preferred
Stock), and $7.88 per share for each share of the Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any
stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with
respect to such series of Preferred Stock). Any partial payment shall be made ratably among the
holders of Preferred Stock in proportion to the payment each such holder would receive if the
full amount of such dividends were paid.

1.2 Participation. If, after dividends in the full preferential amount specified
in Section 1.1 for the Preferred Stock have been paid or set apart for payment in any calendar
year of the Corporation, the Board shall declare additional dividends out of funds legally
available therefor in that calendar year, then such additional dividends shall be declared pro rata

on the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of
shares of Common Stock held by such holders. For this purpose each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock is to be treated as holding the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock
then issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to
Sections 4 and 5.

1.3. Non-Cash Dividends. Whenever a dividend provided for in this Section 1
shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such dividend shall be deemed to be the
fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board.

2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up; Certain Mergers, Consolidations
and Asset Sales.

2.1 Payments to Holders of Series C Preferred Stock. In the event of any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or any
Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined below), before any payment shall be made to the holders
of the Junior Preferred Stock (as defined below) and the Common Stock by reason of their
ownership thereof, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be
entitled to be paid on a pari passu basis out of the funds and assets available for distribution to its
stockholders, an amount per share equal to the greater of (a) the Original Issue Price for the
Series C Preferred Stock, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (b) such amount per
share as would have been payable had all shares of such series of Preferred Stock been converted
into Common Stock pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 immediately prior to such liquidation,
dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event. If upon any such liquidation, dissolution,
winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event of the Corporation, the funds and assets available for
distribution to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be insufficient to pay the holders of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock the full amounts to which they are entitled under this Section
2.1, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the
funds and assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts that would
otherwise be payable in respect of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by them upon such
distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

2.2 Payments to Holders of Series Seed, Series A, and Series B Preferred
Stock. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation or any Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined below), after the payment of all
preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock as
provided in Section 2.1 by reason of their ownership thereof, and before any payment shall be
made to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, the holders of shares
of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
(collectively, the “Junior Preferred Stock”) then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid on a
pari passu basis out of the funds and assets available for distribution to its stockholders, an
amount per share equal to the greater of (a) the applicable Original Issue Price for such series of
Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, plus any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (b) such amount per share as would have been payable
had all shares of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock, respectively, been converted into Common Stock pursuant to Sections 4 and 5
immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event. If
upon any such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event of the

Corporation, the funds and assets available for distribution to the stockholders of the Corporation
shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock the full amounts to which they are entitled under
this Section 2.12, the holders of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the funds and assets
available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts that would otherwise be
payable in respect of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with
respect to such shares were paid in full.

2.3. Payments to Holders of Common Stock. In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event of the
Corporation, after the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2.1 and 2.2, the remaining funds and assets
available for distribution to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be distributed among the
holders of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares
of Common Stock held by each such holder.

24 Deemed Liquidation Events.

2.4.1 Definition. Each of the following events shall be considered a
“Deemed Liquidation Event’ unless the holders of at least 55% of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis (the “Requisite Super
Majority”) elect otherwise by written notice sent to the Corporation at least five days prior to the
effective date of any such event:

(a) a merger, reorganization, or consolidation (each a
“Combination’) in which (i) the Corporation is a constituent party or (ii) a subsidiary of
the Corporation is a constituent party and the Corporation issues shares of its capital
stock pursuant to such Combination; except any such Combination involving the
Corporation or a subsidiary in which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation
outstanding immediately prior to such Combination continue to represent, or are
converted into or exchanged for equity securities that represent, immediately following
such Combination, at least a majority, by voting power, of the equity securities of (1) the
surviving or resulting party or (2) if the surviving or resulting party is a wholly owned
subsidiary of another party immediately following such Combination, the parent of such
surviving or resulting party; provided that, for the purpose of this Section 2.4.1, all shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options (as defined in Section 5.1 below)
outstanding immediately prior to such Combination or upon conversion of Convertible
Securities (as defined in Section 5.1 below) outstanding immediately prior to such
Combination shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such Combination
and, if applicable, deemed to be converted or exchanged in such Combination on the
same terms as the actual outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted or
exchanged;

(b) the sale, lease, transfer, grant (including the grant of an
Exclusive IP License (as defined below)), or other disposition, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of the

Corporation, of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (or, if substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by one or more subsidiaries, the sale or disposition
(whether by consolidation, merger, conversion or otherwise) of such subsidiaries of the
Corporation), except where such sale, lease, grant, transfer or other disposition is made to
the Corporation or one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of the Corporation (an “Asset
Disposition”),

(c) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a
person or group of affiliated persons (other than an underwriter of this corporation’s
securities), of the Corporation’s securities if, after such closing, such person or group of
affiliated persons would hold fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting stock
of this corporation (or the surviving or acquiring entity);

(d) the grant of an exclusive license to all or substantially all of
the Corporation’s intellectual property that constitutes an effective disposition of such
intellectual property (an “Exclusive IP License’); or

(e) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

2.4.2 Amount Deemed Paid or Distributed. The funds and assets
deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital stock of the Corporation upon any such
Combination or Asset Disposition shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights or
securities paid or distributed to such holders by the Corporation or the acquiring person, firm or
other entity. If the amount deemed paid or distributed under this Section 2.4.2 is made in
property other than in cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such
property, as determined in good faith by the Board; provided, however, that the following shall
apply. For securities not subject to investment letters or other similar restrictions on free
marketability:

(i) if traded on a securities exchange, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the 30-day
period ending three days prior to the closing of such transaction;

(ii) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be
the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period ending three days prior to the
closing of such transaction; or

(iii) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board, including at least one of
the Preferred Directors (as defined below).

The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letters or other similar restrictions on
free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an
affiliate or former affiliate) shall take into account an appropriate discount (as determined in
good faith by the Board, including at least one of the Preferred Directors) from the market value

as determined pursuant to clause (i) above so as to reflect the approximate fair market value
thereof.

The foregoing methods for valuing non-cash consideration to be distributed in connection with a
Combination or Asset Disposition shall, with the appropriate approval of the definitive
agreements governing such Combination or Asset Disposition by the stockholders under the
General Corporation Law and Section 3.3, be superseded by the determination of such value set
forth in the definitive agreements governing such Combination or Asset Disposition.

2.4.3 Effecting a Deemed Liquidation Event. The Corporation shall not
have the power to effect a Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in Section 2.3.1 unless the
agreement or plan of merger or consolidation for such transaction (the “Merger Agreement’)
provides that the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated
among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2.1, 2.2 and
2.3.

2.4.4 Allocation of Escrow and Contingent Consideration. In the event
of a Deemed Liquidation Event, if any portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of
the Corporation is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the “Additional
Consideration”), the Merger Agreement shall provide that (a) the portion of such consideration
that is not Additional Consideration (such portion, the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated
among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2.1, 2.2 and
2.3 as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such
Deemed Liquidation Event; and (b) any Additional Consideration which becomes payable to the
stockholders of the Corporation upon satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among
the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 after
taking into account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same
transaction. For the purposes of this Section 2.4.4, consideration placed into escrow or retained
as holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar obligations in
connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be Additional
Consideration.

3. Voting.

3.1. General. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation
for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written
consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common
Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Fractional votes shall
not be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be
converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).
Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of this Restated Certificate, holders of
Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class on an as-
converted basis, shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of
the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to
notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.

3.2 Election of Directors.

3.2.1 Election. For so long as at least 933,166 shares of Series A
Preferred Stock remain outstanding (as such number is adjusted for stock splits and combinations
of shares and for dividends paid on the Preferred Stock in shares of such stock), the holders of
record of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, exclusively and as a separate class, shall be
entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation (the “Series A Director”); provided that the
initial Series A Director may be elected by the Board. For so long as at least 1,049,421 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding (as such number is adjusted for stock splits and
combinations of shares and for dividends paid on the Preferred Stock in shares of such stock),
the holders of record of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, exclusively and as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation (the “Series B Director’);
provided that the initial Series B Director may be elected by the Board. For so long as at least
222,081 shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding (as such number is adjusted for
stock splits and combinations of shares and for dividends paid on the Preferred Stock in shares of
such stock), the holders of record of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, exclusively and as a
separate class, shall be entitled to elect one (1) director of the Corporation (the “Series C
Director”, and together with the Series A Director and the Series B Director, the “Preferred
Directors’”)), provided that the initial Series C Director may be elected by the Board. The
holders of record of the shares of Common Stock, exclusively and as a separate class, shall be
entitled to elect three (3) directors of the Corporation (the “Common Directors”). The holders of
record of the shares of Common Stock and of every other class or series of voting stock
(including the Preferred Stock), voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall
be entitled to elect the remaining number of directors of the Corporation (the “Remaining
Directors’).

3.2.2 Vacancies Not Caused bv Removal. If any vacancy in the office of
any Common Director or Remaining Director exists, such vacancy may be filled (either
contingently or otherwise) by the stockholders as specified in this Section 3.2 or by at least a
majority of the members of the Board then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining member of the Board then in office, even if such directors or such sole remaining
director were not elected by the holders of the class, classes or series that are entitled to elect a
director or directors to office under the provisions of Section 3.2 (the “Specified Stock”) and
such electing director or directors shall specify at the time of such election the specific vacant
directorship being filled.

3.2.3. Vacancies Caused by Removal. Any director elected as provided
in the preceding sentences may be removed with or without cause by, and any vacancy in the
office of any such removed director may be filled by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the
holders of the shares of the Specified Stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given
either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a
written consent of stockholders.

3.2.4 Procedure. At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a
director, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of the Specified Stock entitled to elect such director shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of
electing such director and the candidate or candidates to be elected by such Specified Stock shall
be those who receive the highest number of affirmative votes (on an as-converted basis) of the

outstanding shares of such Specified Stock. In the case of an action taken by written consent
without a meeting, the candidate or candidates to be elected by such Specified Stock shall be
those who are elected by the written consent of the holders of a majority of such Specified Stock.

3.3 Preferred Stock Protective Provisions. For so long as at least 1,717,479
shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding (as such number is adjusted for stock splits and
combinations of shares and for dividends paid on the Preferred Stock in shares of such stock),

otherwise, do any of the following without (in addition to any other vote required by law or this
Restated Certificate) the written consent, or affirmative vote at a meeting and evidenced in
writing, of the Requisite Super Majority, and any such act or transaction entered into without

reclassification or otherwise) any security convertible into or exercisable for any such
new class or series of capital stock; or

(d) redeem or repurchase any shares of Common Stock or

4. Conversion Rights. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

4.1 Right to Convert.

4.1.1 Conversion Ratio. Each share of a series of Preferred Stock shall
be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time, and without the payment of
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for such series of
Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price (as defined below) for such series of Preferred Stock in
effect at the time of conversion. The “Conversion Price” for each series of Preferred Stock shall
initially mean the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock. Such initial Conversion
Price, and the rate at which shares of Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common
Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.

4.1.2 Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to
voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered
holder alleges that any such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at
the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent),
together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of
the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on
which such conversion is contingent (a “Contingency Event’). Such notice shall state such
holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the
registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on
the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its
own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice
(or, if later, the date on which all Contingency Events have occurred) shall be the time of
conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of
such time. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, (a) issue and

deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder’s nominee(s), a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in
accordance with the provisions hereof and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of
Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common
Stock, (b) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 5.7.3 in lieu of any fraction of a share
of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (c) pay all declared but unpaid
dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted.

4.1.3 Effect of Voluntary Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock that
shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at
the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common
Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise
issuable upon such conversion as provided in Section 5.7.3 and to receive payment of any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be
retired and cancelled and may not be reissued.

4.2. Mandatory Conversion.

4.2.1. Automatic Conversion. Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of
shares of Common Stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act’), in which the valuation of the Corporation is at least $200,000,000 and which
results in at least $50,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation (a “Qualified Public
Offering’) or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written
consent of the holders of the Requisite Super Majority (the time of such closing or the date and
time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent is referred to
herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Time”), (i) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the applicable ratio described in
Section 4.1.1 as the same may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with Section 5 and
(ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation.

4.2.2 Mandatory Conversion Procedural Requirements.

(a) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be
sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place designated for mandatory
conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Sections 4.2.1 and 9. Unless
otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate, such notice need not be sent in advance of the
occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of
shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender such holder’s certificate or certificates for all such
shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost
certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in
such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 4.2.

(b) If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered
for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of
transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to this Section 4.2, including the rights, if any, to receive
notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the Mandatory
Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the
certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender
of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive
the items provided for in the next sentence of this Section 4.2.2(b). As soon as practicable after
the Mandatory Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost
certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to
such holder, or to such holder’s nominee(s), a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof,
together with cash as provided in Section 5.7.3 in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid
dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted. Such converted Preferred Stock shall be
retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock (and the applicable series
thereof) accordingly.

5. Adjustments to Conversion Price.

5.1 Adjustments for Diluting Issuances.

5.1.1 Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article IV, the following
definitions shall apply:

(a) “Option” shall mean any right, option or warrant to
subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities
from the Corporation.

first share of Series B Preferred Stock was issued.

(c) “Convertible Securities” shall mean any evidences of

(d) “Additional Shares of Common Stock” with respect to a
series of Preferred Stock shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to
Section 5.1.2 below, deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the Original Issue
Date, other than the following shares of Common Stock and shares of Common Stock
deemed issued pursuant to the following Options and Convertible Securities (collectively
as to all such shares and shares deemed issued, “Exempted Securities”):

(i) shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities issued as a dividend or distribution on such series of Preferred Stock;

(ii) shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities issued by reason of a dividend, stock split, split-up or other distribution on or

(iv) shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities
actually issued upon the exercise of Options, or shares of Common Stock actually issued
upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities, in each case provided that

(v) shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities issued to banks, equipment lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a
debt financing or equipment leasing transaction approved by the Board (including at least
one of the Preferred Directors);

approved by the Board (including at least one of the Preferred Directors);

(vii) shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities issued in connection with sponsored research, collaboration, technology
license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements or strategic
partnerships approved by the Board (including at least one of the Preferred Directors);

(viii) shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities issued as a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of any series of
Preferred Stock resulting from the operation of Section 5.1.3;

(ix) shares of Common Stock issued in an offering to
the public pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act with, and
declared effective by, the Securities and Exchange Commission; or

(x) as to any particular series of Preferred Stock, the

issuance or deemed issuance of Common Stock if the Corporation receives written notice
from the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of such series of

Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis agreeing that no adjustment shall be made to the
Conversion Price of such series as a result of the issuance or deemed issuance.

5.1.2 Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(a) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding Options or
Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities) or shall fix a record date for
the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or
Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in
the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
convertibility or exchangeability (including the passage of time) but without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number including by way of
anti-dilution adjustment) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date.

(b) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to the terms of Section 5.1.3, are revised as a result of an amendment to such terms or
any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but
excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of
such Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (i) any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of
any such Option or Convertible Security or (ii) any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon
such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred
Stock computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price of
such series of Preferred Stock as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon
the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this Section 5.1.2(b) shall have the effect of increasing
the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount which exceeds the lower of (1)
the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the original
adjustment made as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security, or (2) the
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock that would have resulted from any issuances
of Additional Shares of Common Stock (other than deemed issuances of Additional Shares of
Common Stock as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security) between the
original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

(c) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities that are themselves Exempted Securities), the
issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred
Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 5.1.3 (either because the consideration per share
(determined pursuant to Section 5.1.4) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject
thereto was equal to or greater than the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock then

in effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Original Issue
Date), are revised after the Original Issue Date as a result of an amendment to such terms or any
other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but
excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of
such Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (i) any increase in the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option
or Convertible Security or (ii) any decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended
or adjusted, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the
manner provided in Section 5.1.2(a)) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such
increase or decrease becoming effective.

(d) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) that resulted
(either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the
Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 5.1.3, the
Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price
of such series of Preferred Stock as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible
Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

(e) If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is
calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to
adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of
Preferred Stock provided for in this Section 5.1.2 shall be effected at the time of such issuance or
amendment based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any
provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as
provided in Sections 5.1.2(b) and 5.1.2(c)). If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange,
cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended,
any adjustment to such Conversion Price that would result under the terms of this Section 5.1.2
at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time such number of
shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to subsequent
adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to such Conversion Price
that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first be made.

5.1.3. Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the
Corporation shall at any time after the Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common
Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section
5.1.2), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for
such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issue, then such Conversion
Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-
thousandth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula:

For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

“CP2” shall mean the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately after such issue
or deemed issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock

“CP.” shall mean the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issue or deemed issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

“A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such issue or deemed issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock (treating for this
purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options
outstanding immediately prior to such issue or upon conversion or exchange of
Convertible Securities (including the Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming exercise of
any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);

“B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued or
deemed issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued at a price per
share equal to CP; (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation in respect of such issue by CP); and

“C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock actually issued
or deemed issued in such transaction.

5.1.4 Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 5.1,
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue or deemed issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(a) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(i) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or
payable for accrued interest;

(ii) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in
good faith by the Board; and

(iii) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for
consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received,
computed as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above, as determined in good faith by the
Board.

(b) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Section 5.1.2, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing

(i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus
the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or
in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such
Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of
Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible
Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

5.1.5 Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a
series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 5.1.2 and such issuance dates occur
within a period of no more than 120 days after the first such issuance to the final such issuance,
then, upon the final such issuance, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be
readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such
issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such
subsequent issuances within such period that are a part of such transaction or series of related
transaction).

5.2 Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately
before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If
the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be
decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding. Any adjustment under this Section 5.2 shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

5.3 Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or
fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in
effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the

event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by
multiplying such Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

(a) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or
the close of business on such record date, and

(b) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or
the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion
Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and
thereafter such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5.3 as of the time of
actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (ii) no such adjustment shall be made if
the holders of such series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other
distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had
been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

5.4 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or
fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution
of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then and in each
such event the holders of such series of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the
distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities
in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would have received if all
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on
the date of such event.

5.5 Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If, at any
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date, the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of such series of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation, whether by recapitalization,
reclassification or otherwise (other than by a stock split or combination, dividend, distribution,
merger or consolidation covered by Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 or 5.6 or by Section 2.4 regarding a
Deemed Liquidation Event), then in any such event each holder of such series of Preferred Stock
shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other
securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by
holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock
could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change.

5.6 Adjustment for Merger or Consolidation. Subject to the provisions of

Section 2.4, if there shall occur any consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which
the Common Stock (but not a series of Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for

securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 or
5.5), then, following any such consolidation or merger, provision shall be made that each share
of such series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into
which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other
property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable
upon conversion of one share of such series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in
such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) shall be made in
the application of the provisions in Section 4 and this Section 5 with respect to the rights and
interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions
set forth in Section 4 and this Section 5 shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably
may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion
of such series of Preferred Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.6 shall be
construed as preventing the holders of Preferred Stock from seeking any appraisal rights to
which they are otherwise entitled under the DGCL in connection with a merger triggering an
adjustment hereunder, nor shall this Section 5.6 be deemed conclusive evidence of the fair value
of the shares of Preferred Stock in any such appraisal proceeding.

5.7 General Conversion Provisions.

5.7.1 Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 5, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any
event not later than 15 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance
with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash
or other property into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail
the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of any
series of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to
be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (a) the Conversion Price of such series of
Preferred Stock then in effect and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of
such series of Preferred Stock.

5.7.2 Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times while
any share of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock,
such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without
limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary
amendment to this Restated Certificate. Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the

shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

5.7.3. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the fair value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the
Board. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time
converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion.

5.7.4 No Further Adjustment after Conversion. Upon any conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock, no adjustment to the Conversion Price of the
applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be made with respect to the converted shares for any
declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Preferred Stock or on the Common Stock
delivered upon conversion.

5.7.5 Termination of Conversion Rights. Subject to Section 4.1.2 in the
case of a Contingency Event, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close
of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the first payment of any funds and
assets distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock.

6. No Reissuance of Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Preferred Stock. Any
shares of Preferred Stock that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries shall be automatically and immediately retired and shall not be reissued, sold or
transferred. Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other
rights, powers and preferences granted to the holders of Preferred Stock following the close of
business on the third day preceding the Redemption Date for such shares.

7. Waiver. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of a series of the
Preferred Stock that are set forth herein may be waived on behalf of all holders of such series of
Preferred Stock by the affirmative written consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the shares of such series of Preferred Stock that are then outstanding, treating any convertible
Preferred Stock as-if converted to Common Stock. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and
other terms of the Preferred Stock as a class that are set forth herein may be waived on behalf of
all holders of the Preferred Stock as a class by the affirmative written consent or vote of the
Requisite Super Majority.

8. Notice of Record Date. In the event:
(a) the Corporation shall set a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or

other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Preferred

ARTICLE VIII: DIRECTOR LIABILITY.

A, LIMITATION. To the fullest extent permitted by law, a director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the General Corporation Law or any other law of the
State of Delaware is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VIII to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the General Corporation Law as so amended. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this Article VIII by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of, or
increase the liability of any director of the Corporation with respect to any acts or omissions of
such director occurring prior to, such repeal or modification.

B. INDEMNIFICATION. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
Corporation is authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
directors, officers and agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to which General
Corporation Law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions,
agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145
of the General Corporation Law.

nominated to serve on the Board by, an entity that is a holder of Preferred Stock or any of its
affiliates and that is in the business of investing and reinvesting in other entities (each, a
“Fund”), acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, matter or interest that may be a
corporate opportunity for the Corporation, such director shall to the fullest extent permitted by
law be deemed to have fully satisfied and fulfilled such director’s fiduciary duty to the
Corporation and its stockholders with respect to such potential transaction, matter or interest, and
the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law waives any claim, interest or expectancy
that such potential transaction, matter or interest constituted a corporate opportunity that should
have been presented to the Corporation or any of its affiliates, unless such claim, interest or
expectancy was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director of the
Corporation while such person is performing services in such capacity. Any amendment, repeal
or modification of this Article IX shall be prospective only and shall not affect any right or
protection of such person under this Article IX in effect at the time of the occurrence of any
actions or omissions to act giving rise to liability.
